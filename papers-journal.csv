hal,"Increase in rice productivity in the Senegal River valley due to improved collective management of irrigation schemes .

Village irrigation schemes cover about 25% of the irrigated area on the two banks of the Senegal River. We analyzed irrigation scheme and rice crop management practices during the 1998 wet season in this type of irrigation scheme in Mauritania. Average yield was 4.8 t ha-1; problems with irrigation rules resulted in great variability of irrigation frequency between fields, and sub-optimal timing of nitrogen fertilizer application resulted in yield losses. Based on this diagnosis, we suggested to farmers new irrigation rules and cropping calendars planned on the scale of the irrigation scheme. Planned cropping calendars were built using CalCul, a software that we designed on the basis of the irrigated rice development model RIDEV. These suggestions of improved collective management were implemented in the 1999 and 2000 wet seasons. Average yield reached 7.2 t ha-1 in 1999 and 8.2 t ha-1 in 2000, without any significant increase in production costs. This great increase in rice productivity was mainly due to better collective management obtained through planning cropping calendars. This result showed that technical innovation is not the only way to improve productivity. irrigated rice / West Africa / crop management / input efficiency / decision support tool

1. Introduction
irrigation schemes in the Senegal River Valley cover about 50 000 ha (Saed, 1997; Sonader, 1998). During the 1998 wet season, about 75% of this area was used, i.e. 20 000 ha in Senegal and 18 000 ha in Mauritania, almost exclusively for rice (Oryza sativa L.). Potential rice grain yields (limited by solar radiation and temperature only) are on average about 9 t ha-1 in the wet growing season from July to November (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997) while actual average farmer yields are about 5 t ha-1 (SAED, 1997; SONADER, 1998). Agronomic studies (Le Gal, 1997; Wopereis et al., 1999; Haefele et al., 2001; Poussin et al., 2003) identified sub-optimal timing of crop management interventions (i.e. date of sowing or transplanting, herbicide and fertilizer applications, and harvest and post-harvest activities) as major constraints.

The structural adjustment programs of the 1990s have put the responsibility for management of irrigation schemes in Senegal and Mauritania mostly back into farmers' hands. Decisionmaking on irrigation schedules, land preparation, purchase of inputs (fertilizers and herbicides), harvesting and marketing of
the product is done collectively on the scale of the irrigation scheme. Financing of production costs requires credit obtained through collective loans, paid back after harvest. Moreover, previous loans have to be reimbursed to obtain a new one. Decision-making at the field level by individual farmers is, therefore, strongly influenced by decisions taken collectively at the irrigation scheme level (Poussin, 1995; Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Moreover, improving the productivity for individual farmers in the collective irrigation scheme is not sustainable.

To improve rice productivity, best-bet cropping calendars need, therefore, to be determined collectively at both scheme and field levels. We hypothesize that planning crop calendars on the scale of the irrigation scheme before the beginning of the crop season can improve input efficiency and rice productivity without any technical innovation.

The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate determinants of rice yield in a village irrigated scheme of the Senegal River valley; (ii) develop and evaluate a decision-support tool for improved cropping calendars at the irrigation scheme level; (iii) analyze the effects of changes in collective decision-making on rice yields and profitability.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Site description
Studies were implemented in the village irrigation scheme of Nakhlet, a small village on the northern bank of the Senegal River, 60 km east of Rosso (16degrees 29' N, 15degrees 12' W) in Mauritania. This type of irrigation scheme (or perimeter), with an area of below 50 ha and cultivated by farmers from a single village, covers about 25% of the irrigated area on the two banks of the Senegal River (SAED, 1997; SONADER, 1998).

The perimeter of Nakhlet was built in 1981 for the Mauritanian irrigation and extension authority, the ``Societe Nationale de Developpement Rural'' (SONADER). It covers 27.5 ha, with 119 fields cultivated by 29 farmers. Irrigation is carried out through pumping from a tributary of the Senegal River. Irrigated rice is cultivated only during the wet season, from midJune to the end of November. Crop establishment in all fields is realized using a disk plow and direct sowing of pre-germinated seed. In 1998, 1999 and 2000, farmers used three indica cultivars with slender grain: Sahel 108 (IR13240-108-2-2-3, short duration), Jaya (medium duration) and Sahel 202 (ITA 306, medium duration). The potential yields of these three cultivars are similar and are on average about 8 to 9 t ha-1 in the wet season (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997; WARDA, 1999).

After about 10 years under semi-public management, the Nakhlet farmers' organization took over the perimeter management from 1992. The farmers' organization manages credit provision, water pumping and irrigation, input supply (i.e. herbicides, fertilizers, fuel, etc.), and land preparation. Field irrigation is done by farmers on a rotational basis. This functioning is typical of the village irrigation schemes on the two banks of the Senegal River (Diemer and van der Laan, 1987).
2.2. Agronomic, hydraulic and economic survey
All 119 fields in the Nakhlet perimeter were monitored during the wet seasons of 1998, 1999 and 2000 (1998WS, 1999WS, 2000WS). The survey carried out in the 1998WS was used to determine the initial situation in terms of crop and water management, and sources of yield gap and variability. The topsoil (0 to 0.2 m depth) from all fields was sampled in 1998 before the onset of the growing season (one composite sample from 4 samples taken at random per field). Soil analyses (clay content, C and N content, P-Olsen, pH, electrical conductivity, CEC and exchangeable K) were conducted in the IRD laboratory in Dakar, Senegal, following standard methodologies.

The cultivars sown, type of seed (certified or retained from previous harvest), types and rates of applied fertilizers, type of weed control (manual or chemical) and rates of applied herbicides were recorded for each field. The dates of each management intervention (i.e. land preparation, irrigation, sowing, weed control, fertilizer applications and harvesting) were also recorded. Moreover, visual scores of weed infestation were taken at panicle initation in each field. Four scores, corresponding to four classes of surface area coverage by weeds, were distinguished: 0 for none; 1 for weak (less than 10% of surface area coverage by weeds); 2 for strong (between 10 and 30%); 3 for
very strong (more than 30% of surface area coverage by weeds). Poussin et al. (2003) showed that a weed surface cover of less than 10% at panicle initation corresponded to a dry weed biomass of between 0 and 24 g m-2, a surface cover between 10 and 30% corresponded to a weed biomass of between 13 and 228 g m-2, and a cover of more than 30% corresponded to a biomass greater than 130 g m-2. Grain yield (corrected for 14% moisture) was determined at maturity in the center of each field using a sampling area of 25 m2. Grain rice yield of the whole field can be slightly overestimated, but comparisons between years at the perimeter level are still relevant.

The volume of water pumped into the Nakhlet perimeter in 1998 and 1999 was monitored daily during the wet season. The discharge measurement at the head of the perimeter was ensured through a rectangular weir installed at the outflow point of the stilling basin of the pump. The characteristics of this flume (length, width and discharge coefficient) enabled the calculation, using the Manning-Strickler formula, of the discharge according to the water level upstream of the flume, measured through a gauge placed inside the stilling basin (Bos et al., 1991): Q = Cd.b.(2.g)0,5.H1,5. Where Q is the discharge (in m3 s-1), b the breadth of the control section (m), Cd the discharge coefficient, g the gravitational acceleration (m s2) and H the upstream head above the crest (m). A counter was installed on the pump to measure the operational hours. Irrigation water volume was estimated to be 70% of pumped inflow to allow for conveyance losses (Tuzet and Perrier, 1998). We further assumed that irrigation water was distributed homogeneously in the irrigated fields. No measurements were conducted during the 2000 wet season, as similar water allocation rules were applied to those in 1999.

Farmers financed their production costs through bank loans obtained by the farmers' organization. The Nakhlet farmers' organization purchased inputs and provided farmers with certified seeds, fertilizers and herbicides, according to the area of their fields. After harvest, farmers reimbursed the farmers' organization in rice paddy, which was sold by the farmers' organization to pay back the bank. Rice paddy is sold to the state, which guarantees a paddy price of between 38 and 45 Uguiya (Mauritanian currency [UM]) per kg (1 UM = 0.0032 Euro as of March 2004), depending on milling recovery (SONADER, 1998). A financial survey was conducted at the perimeter level during the 1998, 1999 and 2000 wet seasons. Production costs were calculated for each individual field. Irrigation costs included fuel, engine oil, maintenance and pump attendant salary. Cropping costs included land preparation, use of certified seeds, and purchase of fertilizers and herbicides. Their costs corresponded to suppliers' and providers' invoices. Costs of seeds retained from the previous harvest were estimated as 45 UM kg-1. Harvest was done manually by each farmer in the 1998 and 1999 wet seasons and by a combine harvester through a service provider in the 2000WS. Comparison between years was made excluding harvest costs. Organizational changes in 1999 and 2000 did not modify the amount of work done by the farmers. Comparison between years was made excluding labor costs. The gross product of the perimeter corresponded to the total rice paddy production value. The average paddy selling price was 42 UM kg-1.

2.3. Use of models for diagnosis: evapotranspiration, potential yield and development of irrigated rice .

Daily rainfall during the 1998, 1999 and 2000 wet seasons was measured in Nakhlet using a pluviometer. Reference evapotranspiration was calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation (Smith et al., 1992; Allen et al., 1998) and weather data recorded at the experimental station of WARDA (West African Rice Development Association) in Fanaye (16degrees 33' N, 15degrees 46' W), near Nakhlet, on the Senegalese bank. The evapotranspiration of rice is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration with a varying crop factor (kc). The set of kc-values given by FAO (1986) and Siddeek et al. (1988) are used: kc being 1.15 during the vegetative growth phase, 1.3 during the reproductive phase, and 1.05 after the first week of maturation. Cumulative potential evapotranspiration of rice during the crop season was compared with the total of irrigation water supply and rainfall.

The rice growth model ORYZAS (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997) simulates energy-limited and temperature-limited potential rice yield in the Sahel using daily minimum and maximum temperatures, solar radiation and geographical latitude (to calculate photoperiod). This model was used to calculate potential yields in the 1998WS, 1999WS and 2000WS using climatic data recorded in Fanaye.

The rice phenology model RIDEV (Dingkuhn et al., 1995) simulates irrigated rice development in the Sahel and provides crop management recommendations based on crop phenology at the field level. For a cultivar, a sowing date and a planting method (direct sowing or transplanting), RIDEV provides (i) the percentage of spikelet sterility due to cold or heat during flowering; (ii) dates of critical stages in rice development (flowering and maturity), and (iii) optimal timing for transplanting, weeding, fertilizer application, last drainage before harvest and harvest. Input data are geographical latitude of the site, daily minimum and maximum temperatures, and photothermal characteristics of the rice cultivar (Dingkuhn and Miezan, 1995). This model was used to reconstruct the rice development and to determine spikelet sterility percentage in each field during the wet seasons of 1998, 1999 and 2000 using daily temperatures recorded in Fanaye. RIDEV was also used to evaluate differences between optimal and actual cropping calendars in each field.
2.4. Planning cropping calendars at the perimeter level
RIDEV was used to develop CalCul (``Calendrier Cultural''), a software package written in the C language for the Microsoft Disk Operating System, that provides an optimal cropping calendar for irrigated rice on the scale of irrigation schemes in the Sahel (Poussin, 2000). This cropping calendar takes into account the organization of collective operations (i.e. operations that are collectively managed): mechanized land preparation, flooding before land preparation (pre-flooding) or before sowing (flooding), transplanting and mechanized harvest (manual harvest is often carried out individually, but mechanized harvest is carried out collectively). Input data are: (i) planned date for the start of the sowing period; (ii) rice cultivar sown; (iii) planting method (assumed to be common to all fields); (iv) duration of each collective operation for the whole
perimeter, i.e. land preparation, flooding and pre-flooding (assumed to last the same time), transplanting (if this is the planting method chosen) and harvest. Moreover, in the case of pre-flooding, the average duration of soil drainage is needed.

To prevent leakage, flooding and land preparation are usually not performed at the same time; fields are usually flooded just before sowing or transplanting and this first flooding can last 2 days for each field. The optimal timing of transplanting, fertilizer top-dressed applications and harvest are based on rice phenology. To obtain an optimal cropping calendar in each field, operations (sowing, transplanting, fertilizer top-dressed applications and harvest) should have the same duration at the perimeter level. Without a common duration (for example, sowing nursery lasts 2 days and transplanting lasts 15 days on the scale of the perimeter), timing will be sub-optimal in some fields. The slowest collective operation set is therefore the common duration of all the cultural interventions, particularly sowing.

Farmers often choose their rice cultivar individually (Poussin, 1995) and direct sowing and transplanting can coexist in the same irrigation scheme (Poussin, 1997). Nevertheless, they can agree to choose one or two common cultivars, or cultivars with similar duration. The cultivar with the shortest duration would then be sown at the end of the sowing period to minimize the total crop duration on the scale of the perimeter. Direct sowing and transplanting lead to different crop development duration for the same cultivar. In the case of both planting methods, two cropping calendars at the perimeter level should be made.

CalCul uses the phenology model RIDEV (Dingkuhn et al., 1995) to simulate rice development for the first cultivar sown at the beginning of the sowing period (S1), and for the second cultivar sown at the end of the sowing period (S2). The duration of the sowing period is the duration of the slowest collective operation. These 2 simulations (S1 and S2) are made using historical weather data recorded near the site. Each simulation provides average and extremes of dates for several stages (Fig. 1): start of tillering, panicle initiation, heading, flowering and maturity. Spikelet sterility percentages (average and maximum) for S1 and S2 are also calculated.

At the perimeter level, the timing of each stage will be an average between the mean of dates for S1 and S2, and could start at the earliest at the minimum date for S1 and could end at the latest at the maximum date for S2. The starting and end dates (averages and extremes) of crop management interventions (weed management, fertilizer applications, last drainage and harvest) are based on rice phenology. The first flooding can last 2 days for each field and ends the day before sowing (or transplanting); land preparation ends just before flooding starts (it can end at the latest the day before the end of flooding); preflooding starts according to the duration of soil drainage.

The weeding and fertilizer management suggested by CalCul complies with WARDA recommendations (Wopereis et al., 2001). The first weeding can be done chemically with preemergence or post-emergence herbicides, and a second weeding can be done manually before the second N top dressing. Nitrogen fertilizer supply is suggested to be split into 2 or 3 topdressed applications at the start of tillering, panicle initation and possibly heading. P and K fertilizer management is not specified. Contrary to SONADER and SAED (``Societe d'Amenagement
et d'Exploitation des terres du Delta et de la vallee du Senegal'', Senegalese irrigation and extension authority) recommendations, farmers generally merge P fertilizer with the first N topdressed application (Wopereis et al., 1999; Poussin et al., 2003). Basal application of K fertilizer before land preparation depends on soil exchangeable K status (Haefele et al., 2001). Cropping calendars for each field should follow the cropping calendar built on the scale of the perimeter. The realization of
each operation in the fields should follow the water allocation cycle.

CalCul software was used to make the planned cropping calendars of the 1999 and 2000 wet seasons. Simulation calendars were made taking into account technical choices made by farmers (cultivar, sowing period, planting method and use of preflooding) and using historical weather data recorded in Rosso between 1970 and 1984.
2.5. Technical organization changes
Surveys during the 1998WS showed great variability in irrigation frequency between fields, and sub-optimal timing of nitrogen fertilizer application resulted in rice yield losses (see details in results and discussion). This diagnosis of the 1998WS was explained and discussed with farmers during a general meeting in Nakhlet in April 1999. Farmers were invited to implement several changes in their technical organization. These changes were meant to (i) reduce the variability in irrigation frequency between fields and (ii) reduce the gap between optimal and actual cropping calendars.

Thus, it was suggested to continue the water allocation cycle after rain (i.e. water allocation is not re-initialized and re-starts after rain in the next fields). In order to install an information system on field irrigation, a map of the perimeter (based on a cadastral survey; all the farmers could identify their own fields on this map) was posted showing weekly which fields had to be irrigated (based on the irrigation schedule). The farmer who was in charge of field irrigation had to notify on this map which fields were irrigated in order to inform the other farmers (field irrigation is done by farmers on a rotational basis). It was also suggested they should plan cropping calendars at the perimeter level for the next wet season and post a map of the perimeter (based on a cadastral survey) showing weekly which operation had to be done and which field had to be treated (based on the planned cropping calendars and water allocation cycle). Agricultural advisors of SONADER, that were present at the general meeting, also suggested in the 1999WS pre-flooding one month before land preparation in order to reduce early weed infestation, and using certified seed of Sahel 202 in the 2000WS. Farmers accepted these suggestions. They chose furthermore to grow only one cultivar (Jaya in the 1999WS and Sahel 202 in the 2000WS) and to delay the sowing period to make sure harvest would be after the rainy period.

Planned cropping calendars were built for the 1999 and 2000WS using CalCul (Fig. 1). Flooding was the slowest collective operation and set the common duration of crop management interventions on the scale of perimeter. After this planning, there was no interference in farmers' practices during the cropping season. The surveys made in the 1999WS and 2000WS were compared with the 1998WS to evaluate the effects of these changes on yields and profitability.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Diagnosis of the 1998 wet season
In the 1998WS, farmers sowed Jaya between 20 June and 1 July (Tab. I) on 15.5 ha (65 fields) and Sahel 108 on 12.5 ha (54 fields). Sahel 108 was cultivated in Nakhlet for the first time that year. Sahel 108 seeds were certified; Jaya seeds were retained from the previous harvest. Harvest occurred from 4 to 7 November, an average of 135 days after sowing for Jaya and 129 days after sowing for Sahel 108. All fields were manually harvested. Maturity dates simulated with the model RIDEV for each field were an average of 118 days after sowing for Jaya and 109 days after sowing for Sahel 108. The average harvest
delay was, therefore, 17 days for Jaya and 20 days for Sahel 108.

RIDEV simulations indicated no problems with spikelet sterility in any field (i.e. simulated spikelet sterility ratio < 5%) and average of potential yield calculated with the model ORYZAS was 8.7 t ha-1 for Jaya and 8.2 t ha-1 for Sahel 108. Rice grain yield measured at maturity ranged from 2.7 t ha-1 to 7.1 t ha-1, with an average of 4.8 t ha-1. Low yields were mainly localized in the fields far away from the irrigation source. The average yield for Jaya (5.5 t ha-1) was significantly higher (Student's test, P < 0.0001) than for Sahel 108 (4.0 t ha-1). Farmers wanted therefore to understand the origins of yield variability and the clear differences between cultivars.
3.1.1. Soil variability
The results of soil analyses corresponded well with soil characteristics in irrigated schemes of the Senegal River valley described by Haefele et al. (2001). Topsoil clay content varied with distance from the bank, ranging from about 35% to 55%. C content ranged from 4.4 to 7.9 g mg kg-1 soil, with an average of 6.2 g kg-1, and N content ranged from 0.37 to 0.71 g kg-1 soil, with an average of 0.52 g kg-1. CEC varied from 18 to 29 cmol kg-1 and was well correlated with clay content (r2 = 0.823). Exchangeable K ranged from 0.4 to 0.9 cmol kg-1 soil, with an average of 0.7 cmol kg-1. P-Olsen ranged from 4.3 to 17 mg kg-1 soil, with an average of 10.2 mg kg-1. P and K availabilities are above the critical levels for rice (Dobermann et al., 1995; Sanchez, 1976). Electrical conductivity ranged from 0.4 to 1.5 mS cm-1 with an average of 0.9 mS cm-1, and pH ranged from 5.8 to 6.5 with an average of 6.1, which do not constitute constraints for irrigated rice cropping when irrigation is well managed (Asch and Wopereis, 2000). We assumed, therefore, that initial soil P and K status, and soil salinity levels when irrigation is well managed, were not hampering rice growth.
3.1.2. Irrigation management
Irrigation started on 19 June 1998 with flooding before direct sowing and ended on 30 September 1998. The total pumped water volume was 265 700 m3, including 79 000 m3 for flooding (Tab. ii). The average irrigation water supply in the fields was estimated at 756 mm and rainfall was 207 mm, whereas evapotranspiration of the rice was estimated at 802 mm. The total of irrigation water supply and rainfall was about 160 mm above the evapotranspiration of the rice, but water losses through percolation could be estimated at about 2 mm per day (i.e. more than 200 mm from sowing to maturity) for this type of soil (Raes et al., 1997).

Fields were irrigated 4 to 9 times after flooding. Estimated irrigation water supply (flooding included) ranged from 528 mm to 828 mm as a function of irrigation frequency (Tab. iii). Irrigation frequency and irrigation water supply were lower in the fields relatively far away from the irrigation source, that were mostly sown with Sahel 108. Water allocation rules based on re-initializing the water allocation cycle after rain contributed to this irrigation frequency heterogeneity (water allocation cycle started in the fields near to the irrigation source). Effects of irrigation frequency (through irrigation water supply and risk of water shortage) on rice yield during the 1998WS were strongly significant (Student's test, P < 0.0001). Fields irrigated
less than 7 times after flooding were mainly sown with Sahel 108 (Tab. III); the irrigation water supply was below 700 mm and the average yield was 4.2 t ha-1. Fields irrigated at least 7 times after flooding were mainly sown with Jaya; the irrigation water supply was above 700 mm and the average yield was 5.3 t ha-1. This could explain the yield gap between Jaya and Sahel 108. Nevertheless, the average of yield obtained with Jaya was still significantly higher in the fields irrigated 6 to 7 times after flooding, where both cultivars were sown (see Tab. iii).
3.1.3. Weeding and fertilizer management
A total of 110 liters of propanil and 55 liters of 2,4-D amine were bought by the Nakhlet farmers' organization before the 1998WS and distributed to farmers according to the surface area of their fields. The first weeding was done using herbicides in all fields with an average of 4 liters of propanil ha-1 and 2 liters of 2,4-D amine ha-1, combined. The timing of herbicide application was on average 27 days after sowing. The delay between optimal (simulated with the model RIDEV) and actual
weeding timing ranged from -2 to 17 days. Despite heavy weed infestation observed at panicle initation (average of visual score > 1, see Tab. I), a second manual weeding was only done on a minority of fields. Late weeding with low herbicide rates and virtual absence of manual weeding was also observed by Haefele et al. (2001) as a usual practice in Mauritania, and by Poussin et al. (2003) in Senegal. Moreover, visual scores of weed infestation at panicle initation were greater in the fields far from the irrigation source (with low irrigation frequency and, therefore, high risk of water shortage), mostly sown with Sahel 108.

The Nakhlet farmers' organization bought 7 tonnes of urea (46% of N) and 2.75 tonnes of triple superphosphate (20% of P). Fertilizers were given to farmers proportionally to their cultivated area at the rate of 250 kg urea ha-1 (115 kg N ha-1) and 100 kg triple superphosphate (20 kg P ha-1), i.e. close to the recommendations of 120 kg N ha-1 and 20 kg P ha-1. 117 kg N ha-1 and 19 kg P ha-1 were applied in two top-dressed applications (Tab. i). Farmers had problems dividing fertilizer bags.

That explained the variability of applied N fertilizer, that ranged from 90 kg N ha-1 to 150 kg N ha-1. Nevertheless, rates over 90 kg N ha-1 did not have a significant effect on rice yield (Fig. 2). This corresponded to a strong variability of N fertilizer efficiency already observed by Wopereis et al. (1999) and Haefele et al. (2001) in similar situations.

All farmers applied fertilizer in two top-dressings (Tab. i). With the first split, on average at 36 days after sowing, all of the triple superphosphate and half of the urea were applied. The rest of the urea was applied at about 60 days after sowing. Optimal dates simulated with RIDEV for these two splits were on average 23 days after sowing and 60 days after sowing for Jaya and 23 days after sowing and 50 days after sowing for Sahel 108. The delay between actual and optimal dates ranged from 2 to 23 days for the first split and from -9 to 21 days late for the second split. Increasing delay of N application led to considerable drops in maximum yield (Fig. 3), i.e. decreasing applied N efficiency. The delay of the second split for Sahel 108 (on average 11 days) was greater than for Jaya (on average 1 day). Farmers respected quite well agricultural advice that recommended a second split at 60 days after sowing (SONADER, 1998). However, this recommendation did not concord with Sahel 108 duration, which is on average 10 days shorter than Jaya duration in the wet season (RIDEV simulations with daily temperatures recorded in Rosso, 1970-1984).

Therefore, lower irrigation frequency combined with stronger weed infestation and greater delays for N fertilizer application in fields sown with Sahel 108 than in fields sown with Jaya explained the yield differences observed between the two cultivars.
3.2. Diagnosis of the 1999 and 2000 wet seasons
In the 1999 and 2000 wet seasons, the potential rice grain yields were between 8.8 t ha-1 and 9.2 t ha-1 (i.e. about 1 t ha-1 more than in the 1998WS) whilst the average of the actual yield increased greatly (Tab. i). It reached 7.2 t ha-1 in 1999 and 8.2 t ha-1 in 2000 (i.e. 2.4 and 3.4 t ha-1 more than in the 1998WS). Nevertheless, the standard deviation of yield increased slightly (1.4 t ha-1 in 1999 and 1.8 t ha-1 in 2000), indicating continued heterogeneity between fields.
3.2.1. Irrigation management
In the 1999WS, the total pumped water was 78 100 m3 higher than in the 1998WS (Tab. ii). This increase was mainly due to a pre-flooding irrigation that used 70 100 m3 of pumped water. The first flooding used 70 300 m3 (8 700 m3 less than in the 1998WS) and irrigation after flooding used 233 000 m3 (16 700 m3 more than in the 1998WS). The average irrigation water supply (excluding pre-flooding) in the fields was estimated at 768 mm. Rainfall contributed 183 mm. Total water
supply after pre-flooding was estimated at 961 mm compared with 951 mm in the 1998WS, whereas evapotranspiration of the rice was estimated at 774 mm compared with 802 mm in the 1998WS. The irrigation water supply variability between fields was lower in 1999 than in 1998 (72 mm vs. 110 mm, see Tab. ii). Farmers respected the new water allocation rules and the irrigation planning, and all fields were irrigated 8 or 9 times after flooding. The increase in irrigation frequency compared with the 1998WS did not lead to a strong increase in pumped water amount. In the 2000WS, farmers did not pre-flood and all fields were irrigated 8 or 9 times after flooding, respecting the water allocation rules and irrigation plan.

The increase in irrigation frequency reduced the risk of water shortage. Based on the 1998WS results (Tab. III), the increase in irrigation frequency alone could not explain the increase in rice yield with the Jaya cultivar (1.7 t ha-1 in 1999 and 2.7 t ha-1 in 2000). Irrigation management was therefore not the only factor contributing to yield increase.
3.2.2. Land preparation, flooding and sowing
In the 1999 and 2000WS, farmers chose to delay the sowing period to make sure that harvesting would not occur during the rainy period, while keeping a spikelet sterility percentage lower than 10% (simulated with the software CalCul using daily temperatures recorded in Rosso, 1970-1984). In the 1999WS, most farmers used the cultivar Jaya, with seeds retained from the previous harvest (despite the recommendations of agricultural advisors). With sowing between 7 and 22 July, maturity came in early November (Tab. i). In the 2000WS, they used cultivar Sahel 202, with certified seeds (as recommended by agricultural advisors). With sowing between 19 July and 4 August, maturity came at the end of November. Spikelet sterility simulated with the model RIDEV for both wet seasons was lower than 10% in all fields.

Planned sowing dates were well respected in the 1999 and 2000WS (see Tab. i). The planned cropping calendar indicated the start of first flooding 3 days before sowing, but farmers sowed the same day as flooding. Land preparation was realized using disk plows 2 days before flooding in the 1999WS and one week before flooding in the 2000WS, and lasted 3 or 4 days in both wet seasons. The gap between actual and planned dates for land preparation and flooding had no effect on following crop management interventions.

In the 1999WS, fields were pre-flooded about 2 weeks before the planned period (from 5 May to 6 June vs. from 5 to 17 June, see Tab. I) to be sure that weeds could come up before land preparation. Weeds were eliminated by land preparation about 1 month after pre-flooding. Early weed infestation was low and farmers refrained from herbicide use. In spite of its efficiency on early weed control and its low cost (fuel consumption was about 1 000 liters for pre-flooding, corresponding to 66 000 UM; see Tab. IV), farmers did not repeat pre-flooding in the 2000WS. Pre-flooding requires the farmers' presence at Nakhlet one month before the beginning of the crop season, but the farmers have other activities as well as irrigated agriculture (Diemer and van der Laan, 1987).
3.2.3. Weed and fertilizer management
In the 1999WS, early weed infestation levels were low. Most farmers preferred manual weeding to save money (about 150 000 UM for the whole perimeter; see Tab. iv). Manual weeding was done at 25 days after sowing (see Tab. I), but it lasted until 13 September in some fields and therefore delayed the first N application. Visual scores of weed infestation at panicle initation were on average lower than in the 1998WS, but standard deviations (1.6 in the 1999WS vs. 1.2 in the 1998WS) indicated strong variability between fields.

In the 2000WS, farmers applied a combination of propanil (4 liters ha-1) and 2,4 D amine (2 liters ha-1) as in the 1998WS (Tab. i). Herbicides were applied 6 days late compared with the planned timing. This delay is partially due to the delivery date (19 August 2000) of the fertilizer and herbicides. Weeding on fields sown before 29 July was therefore inevitably delayed (Fig. 4). This delay of the herbicide treatment directly induced a delay of the first N application. Weed infestation at panicle initation was not very serious in most fields (average visual score < 1), but it was greater in fields sown before 29 July (average visual score 1.8).

In the 1999 and 2000WS, farmers ordered 3 tonnes of diammonium-phosphate (18% N, 20% P) and 5.5 tonnes of urea (46% N) with planned application rates of 100 kg diammonium-phosphate ha-1 and 200 kg urea ha-1, i.e. 20 kg P ha-1 and 110 kg N ha-1. However, diammonium-phosphate fertilizer was not available. Thus, 8.5 tonnes of urea were delivered and given to farmers at the rate of 300 kg urea ha-1. Total applied N was on average 152 kg ha-1 in the 1999 and 2000WS,
with a standard deviation of about 20 kg ha-1. Compared with the 1998WS, the increase in applied N alone could not explain the increase in rice yield. The relation between total applied N and rice yield showed, in fact, that the maximum yield (about 10 t ha-1, see Fig. 2) was reached in the 2000WS with a minimum rate of about 120 kg N ha-1, i.e. equal to the average applied N rate in the 1998WS. This observation agrees well with WARDA recommendations about N fertilizer rates (Wopereis et al., 2001). Yield measured on samples overestimated the yield of fields and could therefore exceed the potential yield calculated with the model ORYZAS. Nevertheless, the maximum yield observed in the 1999 and 2000WS indicated that the potential yield for Jaya and Sahel 202 should be reached in many fields.

As in the 1998WS, N fertilizer was applied in two equal splits. The planned timing for the first split was 23 days after sowing (from 3 to 13 August in the 1999WS and from 14 to 25 August in the 2000WS, see Tab. I) and the planned timing for the second split was 56 days after sowing in the 1999WS (from 5 to 15 September) and 58 days after sowing in the 2000WS (from 18 to 27 September). The delays between optimal and actual timings were on average 9 days in the 1999WS and 6 days in 2000WS for the first split, and 2 days in the 1999WS and 4 days in the 2000WS for the second split. The first split delay was still greater than the second split delay. In the 1999WS, manual weeding partially explained the delay in the first N; in the 2000WS, the herbicide and fertilizer delivery date partially explain this delay in fields sown before 29 July. Nevertheless, delays were significantly reduced (Fischer's test, P < 0.05) in the 1999 and 2000WS as compared with the 1998WS. As in the 1998WS, N fertilizer application delay in the 1999 and 2000WS induced a great drop in maximum yield (Fig. 3).
3.2.4. Harvest
Farmers were able to harvest their fields on time, close to maturity of the rice plants in the 1999WS, with an average grain yield of 7.2 t ha-1. In the 2000WS, combine harvesters were used about 13 days after maturity, and the average grain yield was 8.2 t ha-1.
3.3. Financial profits
During the 1998WS, total costs at the perimeter level (excluding harvesting) amounted to 1.7 million UM, whilst rice paddy production value was 5.4 million UM, and the gross margin was 3.7 million UM (Tab. iv). The gross margin increased to 6.8 million UM in the 1999WS and to 7.5 million UM in the 2000WS. Gross margins roughly doubled, therefore, compared with 1998. Moreover, except for pre-flooding, organizational changes did not increase labor input: timings of crop interventions were modified, but the amount of work done was unchanged.

Rice yield increase is the main factor contributing to this result. As compared with the 1998WS, production costs decreased slightly in 1999 as less herbicides were used despite the introduction of pre-flooding. Production costs further increased in the 2000WS due to the use of certified seeds and the fuel price increase. Similar results were obtained in Mauritania by WARDA working with large-scale farmers cultivating their own irrigation scheme (Haefele et al., 2001).

At the field level, gross margins ranged from about 50 000 to 250 000 UM ha-1 in the 1998WS, from 50 000 to 375 000 UM ha-1 in the 1999WS and from 100 000 to 400 000 UM ha-1 in the 2000WS (Fig. 5). The increase in gross margins per hectare was strongly significant (multiple comparison using Sheffe's test, P < 0.0001). Moreover, gross margin per hectare for the fields sown after 29 July in the 2000WS (late arrival of fertilizers and herbicides did not affect these fields) varied from about 250 000 to 400 000 UM ha-1, i.e. above the gross margin range in the 1998WS. Combine harvesting in the 2000WS cost about 40 000 UM ha-1. Each farmer could easily pay for this supplementary expense.
4. CONCLUSION
Despite roughly similar growth conditions for rice cropping, the gap between potential and actual yield ranged from 2.7 to 7.1 t ha-1 in the 1998WS. Farmers used two cultivars (Jaya and Sahel 108) that had similar potential yields, but the actual yield obtained with Sahel 108 was lower as compared with Jaya. As shown by another study in the Senegal River valley (Poussin et al., 2003), variability in crop management practices was the main contributing factor to this heterogeneity. The survey during the 1998WS revealed high variability for irrigation frequency, for weeding and N application timing, and for total applied N rate. Irrigation frequency, through risk of water shortage, had a significant effect on yield, and increasing delay of N application led to large yield drops. Total applied N ranged from 90 to 150 kg ha-1, but no direct relation was found with rice yield, suggesting a strong variability of N fertilizer apparent recovery rate. The water allocation rules led to low irrigation frequency in fields far from the irrigation source. These
fields were mainly sown with Sahel 108. Higher weed infestation (partially due to lower irrigation frequency) combined with greater delay for a second N application in fields sown with Sahel 108 explained the yield gap compared with Jaya.

Based on this diagnosis, farmers were invited to change their water allocation rules in order to homogenize fields' irrigation frequency, and to make on the scale of the perimeter a planned cropping calendar for the next season to improve the timing of crop management interventions in all fields. During the 1999 and 2000WS, all fields were irrigated 8 to 9 times after flooding and delays between optimal and actual N fertilizer application timings were reduced. The average rice grain yield reached 7.2 t ha-1 in the 1999WS and 8.2 t ha-1 in the 2000WS, whereas production costs at the perimeter level remained stable. Overall, gross margins at the perimeter level increased by more than 80% as compared with the 1998WS. This increase in irrigated rice productivity was mainly due to better collective management improving input use efficiencies.

These results confirm the importance of good crop management in general in irrigated systems in the Sahel (Wopereis et al., 2001). Current crop management techniques allow one to reach the potential yields of the rice cultivars used. However, farmers' collective organization at the perimeter level and farmers' individual practices at the field level are often sub-optimal. If herbicide and fertilizer rates are often close to recommendations, crop management operation timings are often delayed. Making a planned cropping calendar can therefore assist farmers with crop management. Technical innovation is, therefore, not the only way to improve agricultural productivity.

Soil fertility and crop management by farmers in the Senegal River valley could also depend on other external actors, such as suppliers and motorized service providers. In our study, soil P fertility management depended on the availability of P fertilizer in the suppliers, and late input delivery led to delayed herbicide and fertilizer applications. Le Gal (1997) showed the dependence on combine harvester availability for double rice cropping farmers in the Senegal River delta. In order to prepare for these delivery delays or input and agricultural machinery availabilities, planning cropping calendars can help farmers' organizations to enter early into a contract with suppliers and providers.

EJA,"Determinants of irrigated rice yield in the Senegal River valley .

Determinants of irrigated rice yield were studied in 45 rice fields in the Senegal River valley during 2 years in both wet and dry growing seasons. Grain yields were highly variable, ranging from 0 to 9.5 t ha , with an average yield over years and seasons of 5 t ha , indicating an average yield gap of about 4 /5 t ha 1 between actual farmers' yields and potential yields. Soil P and K status of farmers' fields were mostly above critical limits and pH and electrical conductivity values were in the optimal range for irrigated rice. Average yield levels for three out of the four seasons were not significantly different. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season induced slower development rate and lower above-ground biomass despite higher plant and tiller density at panicle initiation (PI). Analysis of growth cycle and spikelet sterility levels in the sample fields using the RIDEV simulation model showed that yield losses due to cold or heat stress around flowering could be neglected. Yield variability was, therefore, assumed to be mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. Plant density in the dry season was significantly higher than in the wet season in both transplanted and direct-seeded fields, with farmers compensating for retarded growth at the onset of the dry season due to cold temperatures. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities determined at PI. Principal component analyses conducted with three variables, i.e. plant density, tiller density and rice*/above-ground dry weight determined at PI and yield components at maturity allowed to determine the effect of crop management. Sub-optimal weed and N fertilizer management were major factors driving yield variability in farmers' fields. Increasing the productivity of irrigated rice will require collective action at both field and scheme level. # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. all rights reserved.

1. Introduction .

Senegal is one of the countries in West Africa that rely to a large extent on imports to face a growing demand for rice ( /600 000 t year 1). Domestic production covers only about 20% of this demand, of which most is produced in the * Corresponding author. Tel.: /33-467-14-9031; Fax: /33- 467-14-9068.

Senegal River Valley, from a surface area that ranges from 25 000 to 35 000 ha Year 1. Until the
late 1980s, the local irrigation authority SAED (Societe Nationale d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des terres du Delta et des vallees du fleuve
Senegal et de la Faleme) was responsible for the development of irrigation in Senegal. SAED
managed irrigation and drainage infrastructure,
land preparation, purchase of inputs, and bought paddy at subsidized prices (Le Gal and Dia, 1991).

In 1987, SAED withdrew from the rice production process. Since 1994, all rice irrigation schemes
have been privatized and most irrigation schemes
are now managed by farmer organizations.

Double cropping (growing rice in the wet and dry seasons on the same field) is possible, but
hardly practised in the Senegal River valley (Le
Gal and Papy, 1998). The potential grain yield that can be obtained ranges from 8 to 9 t ha 1 in the wet season (July sowing) and from 6 to 11 t ha 1
in the dry season (February sowing). Potential yields generally decline moving inland because of
heat stress at flowering (Dingkuhn and Sow,
1997). Farmers' yields are on average between 4 and 5 t ha 1, and, therefore, far below potential
yields. Crop management practices among farmers
are highly variable (Poussin, 1995, 1998), especially as far as weed and fertilizer management is
concerned (Diallo and Johnson, 1997; Wopereis et
al., 1999; Haefele et al., 2000).

Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley often need rehabilitation because of land leveling problems and poor condition of irrigation canals. Land preparation is mostly done under dry soil conditions, usually with a disk plow. The resulting seedbed is often uneven with large soil clods (Kante, 1996).

Farmers rarely buy certified seeds. Almost 50% of rice area is sown with seed retained from the previous harvest (Poussin, 1997; Belieres et al., 1997). In the Senegal River delta, the majority of the farmers direct seed rice rather than transplant the crop. Moving inland, transplanting becomes more and more important.

Weed infestation is one of the most important factors reducing rice yields in Senegal (SAED, 1997; Haefele et al., 2000). Yield losses of between 30 and 90% were observed in direct-seeded rice and up to 40% in transplanted rice (Diallo and Johnson, 1997). Haefele et al. (2000) demonstrated that benefits from improved weed control were in the order of 1 t ha 1 or almost 25% above farmers' practice. The most common herbicides are propanil and 2,4-D amine, mostly mixed before spraying. The dosage applied (average of 4.6 and 1.5 l ha 1, respectively; Belieres et al., 1997) are close to recommended doses (6 and 1 l ha 1, respectively). Farmers often delay herbicide application until weeds are impeding rice growth (Haefele et al., 2000), resulting in poor weed control.

J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356342
SAED recommends farmers to apply fertilizer in three splits. The first is a basal application of 100 kg ha 1 of diammonium-phosphate (DAP, containing 18% N and 20% P). The second consists of 100 kg urea (46% N) at the start of tillering for direct seeding, or after the transplanting shock in case of transplanting. The third application consists of 100 kg urea ha 1 at panicle initiation (PI), i.e. at about 1 month after the second split. In practice, farmers rarely apply fertilizers in three applications. Because of late arrival of fertilizers and because farmers want to avoid that weeds profit from basal fertilizer, DAP is often mixed with urea and applied at the start of tillering (Wopereis et al., 1999). Fertilizer use is generally profitable in Sahelian West Africa (Donovan et al., 1999). Soil salinity is very pronounced in the delta of the Senegal River, but salinity levels decrease moving inland (Wopereis et al., 1998).

The objective of this paper is to shed more light on the importance of soil and weather variability and crop management on yield formation in farmers' fields under irrigation in the Senegal River valley.

2. Materials and methods .

2.1. Site description and surveys
The surveys were conducted in the region of Podor (16840?N, 158W), situated in the Senegal River middle valley, about 200 km east of the mouth of the Senegal River (see map in Fig. 1). Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley have been mostly installed on heavy clay (i.e. arid Vertisol, Soil Survey Staff, 1981), locally known as Hollalde or Faux-Hollalde. The first rice crop is sown during the hot dry season (mostly in February) and the second crop during the wet season (mostly in July). Late sowing in the wet season results in a risk of spikelet sterility due to cold in November (Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Air temperatures in February to March are relatively low, slowing down crop development in the dry season. From May to June, hot and dry winds around flowering may cause spikelet sterility (Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Rice fields are flooded
for 100 /120 days during each growth cycle. Irrigation water from the Senegal River is supplied to the field by floating pumps. The potential yield level that can be obtained in Podor with July sowing in the wet season and February sowing in the dry season is about 8 /9 t ha 1 (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997).

Our sample included 45 rice fields cultivated by 11 farmers in 11 irrigation schemes in the Podor region. The survey included 9 fields in the 1994 dry season, 17 fields in the 1994 wet season, 6 fields in the 1995 dry season and 13 fields in the 1995 wet season. Farmers used four indica cultivars: Aiwu (short duration, slender grain), I Kong Pao (short duration, bold grain) and IR1529 and Jaya (medium duration, slender grain). Out of the 45 fields, 27 were transplanted and 18 direct-seeded. Each farmer cultivated various fields in the area in different irrigation schemes and used sometimes more than one crop establishment method. One to four (the exact number depending on field size) 16 m2 micro-plots were installed in each farmer field, yielding 18 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season, 38 in the 1994 wet season, 14 in the 1995 dry season and 28 in the 1995 wet season. On this total of 98 micro-plots, 4 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season, 6 in the 1995 dry season and 1 in the 1995 wet season had no panicles at all at maturity, leaving a total of 87 plots with harvested yield.

2.2. Soil analyses .

The topsoil (0 /0.2 m depth) from all fields was sampled before the onset of the growing season (one composite sample from 5 samples taken at random per field). Soil analyses (P-Olsen, pH, electrical conductivity, CEC and exchangeable K) were conducted in the IRD laboratory in Dakar, Senegal following standard methodologies.

2.3. Fertilizer and weed management practices .

Weed management (mode, dosage, timing and type of herbicide used if any) was monitored for each field. Visual scores of weed infestation were taken at PI and maturity. Three classes of surface area coverage by weeds were distinguished: less than 10%; between 10 and 30%; and more than
J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356 343
30%. These visual estimates were calibrated by estimating oven-dry weight (2 days, 70 8C) of above-ground weed biomass in 25 micro-plots, taking four 0.32 m2 samples per micro-plot, using 0.64 m diameter rings.

Fertilizer management (timing and dosage of fertilizer application) was also monitored. Data obtained for each fertilizer application and farmer were grouped into five classes:
i) timely application, sufficient dosage ( /50
kg N ha 1); ii) timely application, insufficient dosage (B/50
kg N ha 1);
iii) late application, sufficient dosage ( /50
kg N ha 1);
iv) late application, insufficient dosage (B/50
kg N ha 1); and
v) no N application.
2.4. Crop establishment, development and yield components
Four 0.32 m2 samples were taken at PI and maturity using 0.64 m diameter rings placed at random in each micro-plot. At PI, the canopy structure was determinated from the number of plants, number of tillers, and oven-dry weight (2 days at 70 8C) of above-ground rice biomass per unit area. At maturity, rice grain yield (corrected for 14% moisture) and yield components were determined. Yield components included panicle number, spikelet number, straw weight (oven-dry weight of rice green and dead biomass) per unit area, and filled spikelet percentage, and the average weight of one single rice grain (in mg, corrected for 14% moisture) determined from 1000 grains.

2.5. Crop modeling .

The RIDEV model (Dingkuhn et al., 1995b; Dingkuhn, 1997) was used to determine best periods for rice cropping in both growing seasons. The model uses daily minimum and maximum air temperatures, sowing date, variety-specific photothermal constants and crop establishment method as inputs. Outputs are growth duration and
spikelet sterility due to cold stress (mainly in the wet season, but cold may also affect early sowing in the dry season) and heat stress (exclusively during the dry season). Simulations were conducted year-round, using 14 years of weather data from the Podor region for direct-seeded I Kong Pao, a short-duration rice cultivar widely grown in the region in 1994 and 1995. Spikelet sterility percentages were also determined for actual farmer sowing dates and varietal choice using 1994 and 1995 weather data from Podor to investigate if in some cases heat or cold stress affected farmer yields.

2.6. Statistical analyses .

Data analysis first allowed to estimate the effect of year, season and cultivar on yield formation. We subsequently removed these effects through data transformation to analyze the effect of crop management (weeding and N fertilization), regardless of season, year or cultivar.

For each plant variable measured at maturity, the effects of three factors, i.e. year (with two terms: 1994 and 1995), cultivar (with four terms: Aiwu, I Kong Pao, IR1529, Jaya) and season (with two terms: dry season and wet season) were estimated and subsequently removed through within-group reduction. For each plant variable and micro-plot i , the average of a given term over all micro-plots was subtracted from the actual value for this term in micro-plot i , yielding the transformed value. For example, for all microplots i with cultivar c , the transformed value Xi equaled the margin between the original value Xi and the average of X for all micro-plots i with cultivar c . At PI, only the effect of season was removed through normalization (cropping season had an effect on the averages and standard deviations). For each plant variable and microplot i , the average of a given term over all microplots was subtracted from the actual value for the term in micro-plot i , and the result was divided by the standard deviation of the term. For example, for all micro-plots i cropped in the dry season, the transformed value Xi equaled the margin between the original value Xi and the average of X for all micro-plots i cropped in dry season, divided by the
J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356344
standard deviation of X for all micro-plots i cropped in dry season. These transformations can be made under the hypothesis that no interaction exists between the effects (Doledec and Chessel, 1987, 1989).

Two principal component analyses were conducted using the transformed data. The first principal component analysis (PCA1) was conducted for the variables plant density, tiller density and above-ground biomass measured at PI. The factorial axis of PCA1 reflected the canopy architecture measured in the fields at PI. The second analysis (PCA2) included panicle density, straw weight, spikelet density, filled spikelets percentage and single grain weight measured at maturity. Yield was introduced as a supplementary variable in the PCA2 to evaluate the weight of each factorial axis in explaining its variability. The factorial axis of PCA2 reflected the yield structure at maturity. We used software package ADE-4 (Thioulouse et al., 1996).

The effects of crop installation (direct seeding or transplanting) and management (weeding and N fertilizer) were measured on the factor loadings of PCA1 and PCA2 through ANOVA.

3. Results and discussion .

3.1. Effects of soil variability
Soil analyses showed that P Olsen ranged from 5.9 to 32 mg kg 1, with an average of 15.1
mg kg 1. Dobermann et al. (1995) reported critical levels for Olsen plant available P from 4 to 29 mg kg 1. The range of critical levels reported in literature for K availability in rice soils is between 0.1 and 0.4 cmol kg soil 1 (Dobermann et al., 1995). In our fields, exchangeable K values varied from 0.2 to 1.2 cmol kg 1. CEC ranged from 10 to 32 cmol kg 1 and were strongly correlated with clay content (r2 /0.857). CEC may affect availability of micro-nutrients, but no signs of deficiency were observed in any field. Soil texture has an influence on soil-water status, but all fields were well-watered and drought stress did not occur in harvested plots. The pH of the topsoil varied between 5.1 and 7.5. Electrical conductivity (EC) values ranged from 0.02 to 0.23 mS cm 1. These values do not constitute a constraint to irrigated rice cropping (Asch and Wopereis, 2000). We assumed, therefore, that initial soil P and K status and soil salinity levels were not hampering rice growth.
3.2. Effects of weather variability
Rice grain yields ranged from 0 to 9.5 Mg ha 1 (Table 1), with an average yield of 5 t ha 1 over both years and seasons. Yields may have been over-estimated somewhat due to the relatively small size of the micro-plots. The average yield gap between potential yields and farmers' yields was, therefore, about 4 /5 Mg ha 1. Three fields were not harvested in the 1995 dry season and one field in the 1994 dry season due to extensive bird

damage and breakdown of pumps. Only 1994 dry season yields were statistically different from the
other seasons (Table 1). Yield components are
shown per cultivar and season in Table 2. Panicle density was significantly higher, and filled sterility
percentage and single grain weight significantly
lower in the dry season as compared to the wet season (P B/0.0001). Differences in other yield
components were not significantly different.

RIDEV-simulated year-round variability of spikelet sterility and growth duration using Podor
weather data (Fig. 2) are shown in Fig. 3. If one
would accept an average spikelet sterility of 15% or less (this percentage can be greater than 30% in
a specific year), it would be best to sow I Kong Pao in Podor between 7 December and 3 September. If this percentage may not exceed 30% in any year (the maximum spikelet sterility must still be lower than 30%), the most favorable periods are from 22 December to 1 January, from 31 January to 22 February and from 22 March to 24 August. January sowing may lead to flowering in April, when temperatures are still relatively low, in some years leading to spikelet sterility due to cold. February and March sowing may lead to flowering in May to early June, when temperatures are very high, which may lead to spikelet sterility due to heat. For transplanting, these best sowing periods need to be moved forward by 10 /15 days.

At the scheme level, the first two sowing periods (from 22 December to 1 January and from 31 January to 22 February) are too short to sow all the fields. Therefore, the favorable sowing period is from the end of March to the end of August, i.e. about 5 months. The average growth duration in the dry season is about 4 months (Fig. 3), leaving only 1 month to prepare the field for the next crop on the same field. Double cropping requires good collective organization at the scheme scale (Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Farmers will often prefer to grow two crops on different fields or schemes.

RIDEV simulations using actual sowing dates of sample farmers showed that sowing dates were well chosen. Only 1 farmer may have experienced a 10% spikelet sterility problem in the 1995 wet season. The relatively low filled spikelet percentage values in Table 2 are, therefore, due to grain filling problems, and not spikelet sterility.

Yield losses due to late harvesting could not be analyzed in this study as all micro-plots were harvested at physiological maturity. Farmers harvested their fields shortly after physiological maturity in the dry seasons of 1994 and 1995. During the wet seasons of 1994 and 1995 they harvested their fields about 15 days after physiological maturity.

The canopy architecture measured at PI significantly differed (P B/0.0001) in the dry and wet seasons for both crop establishment methods (Table 3). Cold temperatures during crop establishment in the dry season induced lower levels of above-ground biomass and slower development
J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356 347

with higher level of tillering. Farmers compensated for these harsher conditions by using a higher density of sowing or transplanting in the dry season as compared to the wet season.

3.3. Effects of crop management other than choice
of sowing and harvest dates .

3.3.1. Crop establishment .

All farmers used pre-germinated seed, however, the large majority of farmers did not use certified seeds. In direct-seeded fields, between 80 and 200 kg ha 1 was applied, i.e. about 380 /950 grains m 2. Plant density measured at PI was 265 plants m 2, i.e. less than half of the density of seeds sown. Plant density was higher in the dry season than in the wet season. Farmers increased their sowing densities to compensate mortality induced by cold during emergence. Plant density was very variable, both within and between fields. Poor seed quality and poor land preparation and leveling explain the low ratio of plant density over seed density. The variability between fields is related to the use of different seeding rates, but differences in weed infestation levels were also important. The variability of densities was greater in the dry season than in the wet season. Cold temperatures at the onset of rice development increased the effects of variability in emergence conditions (seed quality, land preparation, weed infestation).

Farmers transplanted relatively old seedlings. Seedling age varied from 21 to 42 days (average 32 days) in the wet season and from 26 to 49 days (average 38 days) in the dry season. The number of hills per m2 was substantially greater in the dry season (36) as compared to the wet season (19). Like in direct-seeded fields, farmers compensated for cold at the onset of the dry season by transplanting a higher number of seedlings per hill, and a higher number of hills per m2. The number of seedlings per hill was relatively high, i.e. 3.8 in the wet season and 4.6 in the dry season. Farmers explained that they prefer older seedlings because they are taller and can support higher levels of water in the field. However, older seedlings suffer from prolonged transplanting
shock, reducing tillering capacity (Dingkuhn et al., 1990).

3.3.2. Weed management .

Calibration of visual weed estimates showed that a weed surface cover of less than 10% corresponded to between 0 and 24 g dry weed biomass m 2. A surface cover between 10 and 30% corresponded to a weed biomass between 13 and 228 g m 2, and a cover of more than 30% corresponded to a biomass greater than 130 g m 2. Weed infestation was more pronounced and intervened earlier in the growth cycle in directseeded fields, and weed pressure was higher at the end of the cycle than at PI. At PI, high levels of weed infestation (weed cover /10% of the area) was observed in 33 out the 50 direct-seeded plots and only 11 out the 37 transplanted plots. At maturity, low levels of weed infestation (weed cover B/10% of the area) concerned only 7 direct-seeded plots vs. 17 transplanted plots.

In direct-seeded fields weed control was mainly chemical. Only 1 field did not receive any herbicide. The large majority of farmers used postemergence herbicides. These herbicides require field drainage and should ideally be applied at the 2 /3 leaf stages of weeds. These conditions were, however, rarely followed, as was also observed by Le Gal et al. (1990), Diagne (1995), Diallo and Johnson (1997). The dosage applied was smaller than recommended in 18 out of the 22 fields treated with herbicides. Some farmers hand weeded at tillering stage, however none hand weeded prior to the second N application, which explains the increase in weed biomass towards maturity. In the transplanted fields, 14 out of the 17 fields were treated with pre- or post-emergence herbicides at rates below recommended levels. Only 2 farmers hand weeded before the second N split, and weed biomass increased towards maturity.

3.3.3. Nitrogen fertilizer management .

The average total amount of N applied was 141 kg ha 1 and 33 out of the 45 fields received more than 100 kg ha 1. The average total amount of P applied was 23 kg ha 1 and 34 fields received less than 20 kg ha 1.

J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356 349
In the 27 direct-seeded fields, 10 fields received only 1 split, 7 early in the growth cycle, and 3 late. The first split was applied at the recommended development stage (start of tillering) and at the recommended dosage ( /50 kg ha 1) in 15 fields. The second split was applied at the recommended stage (PI) in 18 fields, but the dosage was below the recommended level (B/50 kg ha 1) in 6 fields. Only 8 farmers followed all recommendations for N application. The majority of farmers that followed recommendations for the first split, also did so for the second N application.

The 18 transplanted fields received all two splits of N, and all farmers applied N to their rice seedling nurseries. The first split in the main field was applied at the recommended development stage (after transplanting shock) and at the recommended dosage in only six fields. The second split was applied at the recommended time in 16 fields, but only three farmers applied 50 kg N ha 1 or more.

Generally, farmers followed recommendations as far as N dosage and number of splits was concerned, but they did not follow recommended application dates. Similar observations were made elsewhere in West Africa (Becker and Johnson, 1999; Wopereis et al., 1999) and Asia (Singh et al., 1995; Cassman et al., 1997). Transplanted fields were generally better followed than direct-seeded fields. The second split was applied at the recommended stage and at the recommended dosage in the majority of cases. N fertilization of the seedling
nursery will have compensated for late application of the first N split, or application of a relatively low dosage. Weed infestation levels were lower in transplanted fields at the beginning of the growth cycle, and N application will, therefore, have been more effective in these fields.

3.3.4. Principal component analyses .

The first axis (S1) of the PCA1 explained 80% of the variability observed (Table 4), indicating a strong correlation between plant density, tiller density and above-ground biomass at PI. S1 measures plant stand and growth at PI. Table 5 shows the effect of weed infestation at PI combined with N management (first application) on the S1 factor loadings. In the direct-seeded plots, management of the first N application had a significant effect on the S1 factor loadings (P B/ 0.01). Negative factor loadings were found if recommendations on the first N application were not followed, and positive factor loadings if the recommendations were followed. For transplanted plots, management of the first N application did not have a significant effect on S1 factor loadings. For both direct-seeded and transplanted microplots, good weed management (weed cover B/ 10%) combined with a first N application following recommendations resulted in the highest average S1 factor loading. The S1 factor loadings for the transplanted micro-plots were significantly lower than those of direct-seeded micro-plots (P B/0.001). Positive S1 factor loadings were only

obtained in fields with a transplanting density of
/20 hills m 2 in the wet season and /40
hills m 2 in the dry season (Fig. 4).

The first two axes of the PCA2 explained 72% of total variance (Table 4). The first axis, explaining 47% of total variability, illustrates the strong correlation between panicle density, straw weight and spikelet density. This axis reflected plant density and yield potential at maturity. The second
axis explained about 25% of variability, representing essentially the variability in filled spikelet
percentage and single grain weight. Yield (transformed data, i.e. margins after removing the
effects of year, variety and season on the averages)
was very well represented on the first axis. Table 6 shows that in both direct-seeded and transplanted
micro-plots, management of the second N application and the level of weed infestation had a significant effect (P B/0.001) on factor loadings
of the first factorial axis of PCA2 (S2). S2 factor
loadings for direct-seeded micro-plots were on average not significantly higher than for transplanted micro-plots (Table 6).

Differences in yield components (margins after removing the effects of year, variety and season on
the averages) between direct-seeded and transplanted plots were quite substantial although yields were similar (Table 7). Transplanted plots
had higher spikelet density than direct-seeded
plots, compensated with slightly lower single grain weight; they had also lower panicle density compensated with higher number of spikelets per
panicle than direct-seeded plots. This lower panicle

density is illustrated by the lower S1 factor loadings at PI. Low S1 factor loadings lead to low S2 factor loadings apart from the wellmanaged plots (weed infestation at maturity B/ 10% area and second N application following recommendation) as shown in Fig. 5.

Well-managed plots in terms of fertilizer and weed management resulted in substantially higher grain yields (increase on average of 2.8 t ha 1, see Table 7). This yield increase in both direct and
transplanted plots was entirely due to an increase in spikelet density linked with an increase in panicle density and/or number of spikelet per panicle. Our results agree well with observations by Haefele et al. (2000) who reported an increase of 2 t ha 1 through improved soil fertility and weed management.

4. Conclusions .

Soil and weather variability had a relatively minor effect on rice yield variability in farmers' fields. Simulation analysis showed that farmers used sowing dates within the window recommended for wet and dry seasons, avoiding spikelet sterility due to cold or heat stress around flowering. Harvest dates were also close to physiological maturity of the rice crop. Yield variability was, therefore, mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season reduced crop growth and increased within-field tiller density variability. Direct seeding resulted in relatively high but strongly variable plant density and more vigorous growth in the vegetative phase than with transplanting. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities at PI, as illustrated by the low S1

factor Loadings in PCA1. Management of the first N split and weed infestation levels had a relatively minor effect on plant stand at PI in transplanted plots, but a very important effect in direct-seeded plots. Management of the second N application and weed infestation levels affected panicle density and the number of spikelets per panicle in both direct-seeded and transplanted plots, but had no effect on single rice grain weight and filled spikelets percentage. Wopereis-Pura et al. (2002) reported benefits from a third N splits in terms of yield and grain quality. None of the farmers in this study applied N in three splits.

Results indicate the importance of good crop management in general in irrigated systems in the Sahel. Yields that are realized in farmers' fields are still far from the potential that can be obtained with the rice cultivars that are being used. Kebbeh et al. (2002) demonstrated that information on improved and integrated crop management (ICM) is crucial to help farmers bridge this yield gap. Increasing fertilizer and herbicide use efficiencies will also reduce losses of N and herbicides to the environment.

Improved and ICM would increase the efficiency of inputs, such as N fertilizer and herbicide and seed quantity used. WARDA and partners have developed improved ICM options for irrigated rice cropping in the Sahel that are within farmers' means, based on farm surveys, and farmer participatory on- and off-station research (Wopereis et al., 2002). For the Senegal River Valley, these options have been summarized in a manual and posters (WARDA and SAED, 2001). These posters are based on RIDEV simulations and are specific to location, crop establishment technique, sowing date and cultivar choice, and can be adapted easily. The posters give a farming calendar with management options for a given site /sowing date /cultivar choice /crop establishment technique combination, and relevant information is given to enable farmers to adapt them according to their means.

However, ICM at the field level is also strongly dependent on the collective organization at the scheme level (Poussin, 1995, 1998; Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Sowing date, crop implantation method, herbicide and fertilizer quantities are not
decided individually and irrigation depends on water allocation rules. IRD and partners have, therefore, developed software that integrates the RIDEV simulation model at the scheme level (Poussin, 2000).

Determinants of irrigated rice yield in the Senegal River valley .

Determinants of irrigated rice yield were studied in 45 rice fields in the Senegal River valley during 2 years in both wet and dry growing seasons. Grain yields were highly variable, ranging from 0 to 9.5 t ha , with an average yield over years and seasons of 5 t ha , indicating an average yield gap of about 4 /5 t ha 1 between actual farmers' yields and potential yields. Soil P and K status of farmers' fields were mostly above critical limits and pH and electrical conductivity values were in the optimal range for irrigated rice. Average yield levels for three out of the four seasons were not significantly different. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season induced slower development rate and lower above-ground biomass despite higher plant and tiller density at panicle initiation (PI). Analysis of growth cycle and spikelet sterility levels in the sample fields using the RIDEV simulation model showed that yield losses due to cold or heat stress around flowering could be neglected. Yield variability was, therefore, assumed to be mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. Plant density in the dry season was significantly higher than in the wet season in both transplanted and direct-seeded fields, with farmers compensating for retarded growth at the onset of the dry season due to cold temperatures. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities determined at PI. Principal component analyses conducted with three variables, i.e. plant density, tiller density and rice*/above-ground dry weight determined at PI and yield components at maturity allowed to determine the effect of crop management.

Determinants of irrigated rice yield were studied in 45 rice fields in the Senegal River valley during 2 years in both wet and dry growing seasons. Grain yields were highly variable, ranging from 0 to 9.5 t ha 1, with an average yield over years and seasons of 5 t ha 1, indicating an average yield gap of about 4 /5 t ha 1 between actual farmers' yields and potential yields. Soil P and K status of farmers' fields were mostly above critical limits and pH and electrical conductivity values were in the optimal range for irrigated rice. Average yield levels for three out of the four seasons were not significantly different. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season induced slower development rate and lower above-ground biomass despite higher plant and tiller density at panicle initiation (PI). Analysis of growth cycle and spikelet sterility levels in the sample fields using the RIDEV simulation model showed that yield losses due to cold or heat stress around flowering could be neglected. Yield variability was, therefore, assumed to be mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. Plant density in the dry season was significantly higher than in the wet season in both transplanted and direct-seeded fields, with farmers compensating for retarded growth at the onset of the dry season due to cold temperatures. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities determined at PI. Principal component analyses conducted with three variables, i.e. plant density, tiller density and rice*/above-ground dry weight determined at PI and yield components at maturity allowed to determine the effect of crop management. Sub-optimal weed and N fertilizer management were major factors driving yield variability in farmers' fields. Increasing the productivity of irrigated rice will require collective action at both field and scheme level. # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. all rights reserved.

1. Introduction .

Senegal is one of the countries in West Africa that rely to a large extent on imports to face a growing demand for rice ( /600 000 t year 1). Domestic production covers only about 20% of this demand, of which most is produced in the * Corresponding author. Tel.: /33-467-14-9031; Fax: /33- 467-14-9068.

Senegal River Valley, from a surface area that ranges from 25 000 to 35 000 ha Year 1. Until the
late 1980s, the local irrigation authority SAED (Societe Nationale d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des terres du Delta et des vallees du fleuve
Senegal et de la Faleme) was responsible for the development of irrigation in Senegal. SAED
managed irrigation and drainage infrastructure,
land preparation, purchase of inputs, and bought paddy at subsidized prices (Le Gal and Dia, 1991).

In 1987, SAED withdrew from the rice production process. Since 1994, all rice irrigation schemes
have been privatized and most irrigation schemes
are now managed by farmer organizations.

Double cropping (growing rice in the wet and dry seasons on the same field) is possible, but
hardly practised in the Senegal River valley (Le
Gal and Papy, 1998). The potential grain yield that can be obtained ranges from 8 to 9 t ha 1 in the wet season (July sowing) and from 6 to 11 t ha 1
in the dry season (February sowing). Potential yields generally decline moving inland because of
heat stress at flowering (Dingkuhn and Sow,
1997). Farmers' yields are on average between 4 and 5 t ha 1, and, therefore, far below potential
yields. Crop management practices among farmers
are highly variable (Poussin, 1995, 1998), especially as far as weed and fertilizer management is
concerned (Diallo and Johnson, 1997; Wopereis et
al., 1999; Haefele et al., 2000).

Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley often need rehabilitation because of land leveling problems and poor condition of irrigation canals. Land preparation is mostly done under dry soil conditions, usually with a disk plow. The resulting seedbed is often uneven with large soil clods (Kante, 1996).

Farmers rarely buy certified seeds. Almost 50% of rice area is sown with seed retained from the previous harvest (Poussin, 1997; Belieres et al., 1997). In the Senegal River delta, the majority of the farmers direct seed rice rather than transplant the crop. Moving inland, transplanting becomes more and more important.

Weed infestation is one of the most important factors reducing rice yields in Senegal (SAED, 1997; Haefele et al., 2000). Yield losses of between 30 and 90% were observed in direct-seeded rice and up to 40% in transplanted rice (Diallo and Johnson, 1997). Haefele et al. (2000) demonstrated that benefits from improved weed control were in the order of 1 t ha 1 or almost 25% above farmers' practice. The most common herbicides are propanil and 2,4-D amine, mostly mixed before spraying. The dosage applied (average of 4.6 and 1.5 l ha 1, respectively; Belieres et al., 1997) are close to recommended doses (6 and 1 l ha 1, respectively). Farmers often delay herbicide application until weeds are impeding rice growth (Haefele et al., 2000), resulting in poor weed control.

J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356342
SAED recommends farmers to apply fertilizer in three splits. The first is a basal application of 100 kg ha 1 of diammonium-phosphate (DAP, containing 18% N and 20% P). The second consists of 100 kg urea (46% N) at the start of tillering for direct seeding, or after the transplanting shock in case of transplanting. The third application consists of 100 kg urea ha 1 at panicle initiation (PI), i.e. at about 1 month after the second split. In practice, farmers rarely apply fertilizers in three applications. Because of late arrival of fertilizers and because farmers want to avoid that weeds profit from basal fertilizer, DAP is often mixed with urea and applied at the start of tillering (Wopereis et al., 1999). Fertilizer use is generally profitable in Sahelian West Africa (Donovan et al., 1999). Soil salinity is very pronounced in the delta of the Senegal River, but salinity levels decrease moving inland (Wopereis et al., 1998).

The objective of this paper is to shed more light on the importance of soil and weather variability and crop management on yield formation in farmers' fields under irrigation in the Senegal River valley.

2. Materials and methods .

2.1. Site description and surveys
The surveys were conducted in the region of Podor (16840?N, 158W), situated in the Senegal River middle valley, about 200 km east of the mouth of the Senegal River (see map in Fig. 1). Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley have been mostly installed on heavy clay (i.e. arid Vertisol, Soil Survey Staff, 1981), locally known as Hollalde or Faux-Hollalde. The first rice crop is sown during the hot dry season (mostly in February) and the second crop during the wet season (mostly in July). Late sowing in the wet season results in a risk of spikelet sterility due to cold in November (Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Air temperatures in February to March are relatively low, slowing down crop development in the dry season. From May to June, hot and dry winds around flowering may cause spikelet sterility (Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Rice fields are flooded
for 100 /120 days during each growth cycle. Irrigation water from the Senegal River is supplied to the field by floating pumps. The potential yield level that can be obtained in Podor with July sowing in the wet season and February sowing in the dry season is about 8 /9 t ha 1 (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997).

Our sample included 45 rice fields cultivated by 11 farmers in 11 irrigation schemes in the Podor region. The survey included 9 fields in the 1994 dry season, 17 fields in the 1994 wet season, 6 fields in the 1995 dry season and 13 fields in the 1995 wet season. Farmers used four indica cultivars: Aiwu (short duration, slender grain), I Kong Pao (short duration, bold grain) and IR1529 and Jaya (medium duration, slender grain). Out of the 45 fields, 27 were transplanted and 18 direct-seeded. Each farmer cultivated various fields in the area in different irrigation schemes and used sometimes more than one crop establishment method. One to four (the exact number depending on field size) 16 m2 micro-plots were installed in each farmer field, yielding 18 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season, 38 in the 1994 wet season, 14 in the 1995 dry season and 28 in the 1995 wet season. On this total of 98 micro-plots, 4 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season, 6 in the 1995 dry season and 1 in the 1995 wet season had no panicles at all at maturity, leaving a total of 87 plots with harvested yield.

2.2. Soil analyses .

The topsoil (0 /0.2 m depth) from all fields was sampled before the onset of the growing season (one composite sample from 5 samples taken at random per field). Soil analyses (P-Olsen, pH, electrical conductivity, CEC and exchangeable K) were conducted in the IRD laboratory in Dakar, Senegal following standard methodologies.

2.3. Fertilizer and weed management practices .

Weed management (mode, dosage, timing and type of herbicide used if any) was monitored for each field. Visual scores of weed infestation were taken at PI and maturity. Three classes of surface area coverage by weeds were distinguished: less than 10%; between 10 and 30%; and more than
J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356 343
30%. These visual estimates were calibrated by estimating oven-dry weight (2 days, 70 8C) of above-ground weed biomass in 25 micro-plots, taking four 0.32 m2 samples per micro-plot, using 0.64 m diameter rings.

Fertilizer management (timing and dosage of fertilizer application) was also monitored. Data obtained for each fertilizer application and farmer were grouped into five classes:
i) timely application, sufficient dosage ( /50
kg N ha 1); ii) timely application, insufficient dosage (B/50
kg N ha 1);
iii) late application, sufficient dosage ( /50
kg N ha 1);
iv) late application, insufficient dosage (B/50
kg N ha 1); and
v) no N application.
2.4. Crop establishment, development and yield components
Four 0.32 m2 samples were taken at PI and maturity using 0.64 m diameter rings placed at random in each micro-plot. At PI, the canopy structure was determinated from the number of plants, number of tillers, and oven-dry weight (2 days at 70 8C) of above-ground rice biomass per unit area. At maturity, rice grain yield (corrected for 14% moisture) and yield components were determined. Yield components included panicle number, spikelet number, straw weight (oven-dry weight of rice green and dead biomass) per unit area, and filled spikelet percentage, and the average weight of one single rice grain (in mg, corrected for 14% moisture) determined from 1000 grains.

2.5. Crop modeling .

The RIDEV model (Dingkuhn et al., 1995b; Dingkuhn, 1997) was used to determine best periods for rice cropping in both growing seasons. The model uses daily minimum and maximum air temperatures, sowing date, variety-specific photothermal constants and crop establishment method as inputs. Outputs are growth duration and
spikelet sterility due to cold stress (mainly in the wet season, but cold may also affect early sowing in the dry season) and heat stress (exclusively during the dry season). Simulations were conducted year-round, using 14 years of weather data from the Podor region for direct-seeded I Kong Pao, a short-duration rice cultivar widely grown in the region in 1994 and 1995. Spikelet sterility percentages were also determined for actual farmer sowing dates and varietal choice using 1994 and 1995 weather data from Podor to investigate if in some cases heat or cold stress affected farmer yields.

2.6. Statistical analyses .

Data analysis first allowed to estimate the effect of year, season and cultivar on yield formation. We subsequently removed these effects through data transformation to analyze the effect of crop management (weeding and N fertilization), regardless of season, year or cultivar.

For each plant variable measured at maturity, the effects of three factors, i.e. year (with two terms: 1994 and 1995), cultivar (with four terms: Aiwu, I Kong Pao, IR1529, Jaya) and season (with two terms: dry season and wet season) were estimated and subsequently removed through within-group reduction. For each plant variable and micro-plot i , the average of a given term over all micro-plots was subtracted from the actual value for this term in micro-plot i , yielding the transformed value. For example, for all microplots i with cultivar c , the transformed value Xi equaled the margin between the original value Xi and the average of X for all micro-plots i with cultivar c . At PI, only the effect of season was removed through normalization (cropping season had an effect on the averages and standard deviations). For each plant variable and microplot i , the average of a given term over all microplots was subtracted from the actual value for the term in micro-plot i , and the result was divided by the standard deviation of the term. For example, for all micro-plots i cropped in the dry season, the transformed value Xi equaled the margin between the original value Xi and the average of X for all micro-plots i cropped in dry season, divided by the
J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356344
standard deviation of X for all micro-plots i cropped in dry season. These transformations can be made under the hypothesis that no interaction exists between the effects (Doledec and Chessel, 1987, 1989).

Two principal component analyses were conducted using the transformed data. The first principal component analysis (PCA1) was conducted for the variables plant density, tiller density and above-ground biomass measured at PI. The factorial axis of PCA1 reflected the canopy architecture measured in the fields at PI. The second analysis (PCA2) included panicle density, straw weight, spikelet density, filled spikelets percentage and single grain weight measured at maturity. Yield was introduced as a supplementary variable in the PCA2 to evaluate the weight of each factorial axis in explaining its variability. The factorial axis of PCA2 reflected the yield structure at maturity. We used software package ADE-4 (Thioulouse et al., 1996).

The effects of crop installation (direct seeding or transplanting) and management (weeding and N fertilizer) were measured on the factor loadings of PCA1 and PCA2 through ANOVA.

3. Results and discussion .

3.1. Effects of soil variability
Soil analyses showed that P Olsen ranged from 5.9 to 32 mg kg 1, with an average of 15.1
mg kg 1. Dobermann et al. (1995) reported critical levels for Olsen plant available P from 4 to 29 mg kg 1. The range of critical levels reported in literature for K availability in rice soils is between 0.1 and 0.4 cmol kg soil 1 (Dobermann et al., 1995). In our fields, exchangeable K values varied from 0.2 to 1.2 cmol kg 1. CEC ranged from 10 to 32 cmol kg 1 and were strongly correlated with clay content (r2 /0.857). CEC may affect availability of micro-nutrients, but no signs of deficiency were observed in any field. Soil texture has an influence on soil-water status, but all fields were well-watered and drought stress did not occur in harvested plots. The pH of the topsoil varied between 5.1 and 7.5. Electrical conductivity (EC) values ranged from 0.02 to 0.23 mS cm 1. These values do not constitute a constraint to irrigated rice cropping (Asch and Wopereis, 2000). We assumed, therefore, that initial soil P and K status and soil salinity levels were not hampering rice growth.
3.2. Effects of weather variability
Rice grain yields ranged from 0 to 9.5 Mg ha 1 (Table 1), with an average yield of 5 t ha 1 over both years and seasons. Yields may have been over-estimated somewhat due to the relatively small size of the micro-plots. The average yield gap between potential yields and farmers' yields was, therefore, about 4 /5 Mg ha 1. Three fields were not harvested in the 1995 dry season and one field in the 1994 dry season due to extensive bird

damage and breakdown of pumps. Only 1994 dry season yields were statistically different from the
other seasons (Table 1). Yield components are
shown per cultivar and season in Table 2. Panicle density was significantly higher, and filled sterility
percentage and single grain weight significantly
lower in the dry season as compared to the wet season (P B/0.0001). Differences in other yield
components were not significantly different.

RIDEV-simulated year-round variability of spikelet sterility and growth duration using Podor
weather data (Fig. 2) are shown in Fig. 3. If one
would accept an average spikelet sterility of 15% or less (this percentage can be greater than 30% in
a specific year), it would be best to sow I Kong Pao in Podor between 7 December and 3 September. If this percentage may not exceed 30% in any year (the maximum spikelet sterility must still be lower than 30%), the most favorable periods are from 22 December to 1 January, from 31 January to 22 February and from 22 March to 24 August. January sowing may lead to flowering in April, when temperatures are still relatively low, in some years leading to spikelet sterility due to cold. February and March sowing may lead to flowering in May to early June, when temperatures are very high, which may lead to spikelet sterility due to heat. For transplanting, these best sowing periods need to be moved forward by 10 /15 days.

At the scheme level, the first two sowing periods (from 22 December to 1 January and from 31 January to 22 February) are too short to sow all the fields. Therefore, the favorable sowing period is from the end of March to the end of August, i.e. about 5 months. The average growth duration in the dry season is about 4 months (Fig. 3), leaving only 1 month to prepare the field for the next crop on the same field. Double cropping requires good collective organization at the scheme scale (Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Farmers will often prefer to grow two crops on different fields or schemes.

RIDEV simulations using actual sowing dates of sample farmers showed that sowing dates were well chosen. Only 1 farmer may have experienced a 10% spikelet sterility problem in the 1995 wet season. The relatively low filled spikelet percentage values in Table 2 are, therefore, due to grain filling problems, and not spikelet sterility.

Yield losses due to late harvesting could not be analyzed in this study as all micro-plots were harvested at physiological maturity. Farmers harvested their fields shortly after physiological maturity in the dry seasons of 1994 and 1995. During the wet seasons of 1994 and 1995 they harvested their fields about 15 days after physiological maturity.

The canopy architecture measured at PI significantly differed (P B/0.0001) in the dry and wet seasons for both crop establishment methods (Table 3). Cold temperatures during crop establishment in the dry season induced lower levels of above-ground biomass and slower development

with higher level of tillering. Farmers compensated for these harsher conditions by using a higher density of sowing or transplanting in the dry season as compared to the wet season.

3.3. Effects of crop management other than choice
of sowing and harvest dates .

3.3.1. Crop establishment .

All farmers used pre-germinated seed, however, the large majority of farmers did not use certified seeds. In direct-seeded fields, between 80 and 200 kg ha 1 was applied, i.e. about 380 /950 grains m 2. Plant density measured at PI was 265 plants m 2, i.e. less than half of the density of seeds sown. Plant density was higher in the dry season than in the wet season. Farmers increased their sowing densities to compensate mortality induced by cold during emergence. Plant density was very variable, both within and between fields. Poor seed quality and poor land preparation and leveling explain the low ratio of plant density over seed density. The variability between fields is related to the use of different seeding rates, but differences in weed infestation levels were also important. The variability of densities was greater in the dry season than in the wet season. Cold temperatures at the onset of rice development increased the effects of variability in emergence conditions (seed quality, land preparation, weed infestation).

Farmers transplanted relatively old seedlings. Seedling age varied from 21 to 42 days (average 32 days) in the wet season and from 26 to 49 days (average 38 days) in the dry season. The number of hills per m2 was substantially greater in the dry season (36) as compared to the wet season (19). Like in direct-seeded fields, farmers compensated for cold at the onset of the dry season by transplanting a higher number of seedlings per hill, and a higher number of hills per m2. The number of seedlings per hill was relatively high, i.e. 3.8 in the wet season and 4.6 in the dry season. Farmers explained that they prefer older seedlings because they are taller and can support higher levels of water in the field. However, older seedlings suffer from prolonged transplanting
shock, reducing tillering capacity (Dingkuhn et al., 1990).

3.3.2. Weed management .

Calibration of visual weed estimates showed that a weed surface cover of less than 10% corresponded to between 0 and 24 g dry weed biomass m 2. A surface cover between 10 and 30% corresponded to a weed biomass between 13 and 228 g m 2, and a cover of more than 30% corresponded to a biomass greater than 130 g m 2. Weed infestation was more pronounced and intervened earlier in the growth cycle in directseeded fields, and weed pressure was higher at the end of the cycle than at PI. At PI, high levels of weed infestation (weed cover /10% of the area) was observed in 33 out the 50 direct-seeded plots and only 11 out the 37 transplanted plots. At maturity, low levels of weed infestation (weed cover B/10% of the area) concerned only 7 direct-seeded plots vs. 17 transplanted plots.

In direct-seeded fields weed control was mainly chemical. Only 1 field did not receive any herbicide. The large majority of farmers used postemergence herbicides. These herbicides require field drainage and should ideally be applied at the 2 /3 leaf stages of weeds. These conditions were, however, rarely followed, as was also observed by Le Gal et al. (1990), Diagne (1995), Diallo and Johnson (1997). The dosage applied was smaller than recommended in 18 out of the 22 fields treated with herbicides. Some farmers hand weeded at tillering stage, however none hand weeded prior to the second N application, which explains the increase in weed biomass towards maturity. In the transplanted fields, 14 out of the 17 fields were treated with pre- or post-emergence herbicides at rates below recommended levels. Only 2 farmers hand weeded before the second N split, and weed biomass increased towards maturity.

3.3.3. Nitrogen fertilizer management .

The average total amount of N applied was 141 kg ha 1 and 33 out of the 45 fields received more than 100 kg ha 1. The average total amount of P applied was 23 kg ha 1 and 34 fields received less than 20 kg ha 1.

J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356 349
In the 27 direct-seeded fields, 10 fields received only 1 split, 7 early in the growth cycle, and 3 late. The first split was applied at the recommended development stage (start of tillering) and at the recommended dosage ( /50 kg ha 1) in 15 fields. The second split was applied at the recommended stage (PI) in 18 fields, but the dosage was below the recommended level (B/50 kg ha 1) in 6 fields. Only 8 farmers followed all recommendations for N application. The majority of farmers that followed recommendations for the first split, also did so for the second N application.

The 18 transplanted fields received all two splits of N, and all farmers applied N to their rice seedling nurseries. The first split in the main field was applied at the recommended development stage (after transplanting shock) and at the recommended dosage in only six fields. The second split was applied at the recommended time in 16 fields, but only three farmers applied 50 kg N ha 1 or more.

Generally, farmers followed recommendations as far as N dosage and number of splits was concerned, but they did not follow recommended application dates. Similar observations were made elsewhere in West Africa (Becker and Johnson, 1999; Wopereis et al., 1999) and Asia (Singh et al., 1995; Cassman et al., 1997). Transplanted fields were generally better followed than direct-seeded fields. The second split was applied at the recommended stage and at the recommended dosage in the majority of cases. N fertilization of the seedling
nursery will have compensated for late application of the first N split, or application of a relatively low dosage. Weed infestation levels were lower in transplanted fields at the beginning of the growth cycle, and N application will, therefore, have been more effective in these fields.

3.3.4. Principal component analyses .

The first axis (S1) of the PCA1 explained 80% of the variability observed (Table 4), indicating a strong correlation between plant density, tiller density and above-ground biomass at PI. S1 measures plant stand and growth at PI. Table 5 shows the effect of weed infestation at PI combined with N management (first application) on the S1 factor loadings. In the direct-seeded plots, management of the first N application had a significant effect on the S1 factor loadings (P B/ 0.01). Negative factor loadings were found if recommendations on the first N application were not followed, and positive factor loadings if the recommendations were followed. For transplanted plots, management of the first N application did not have a significant effect on S1 factor loadings. For both direct-seeded and transplanted microplots, good weed management (weed cover B/ 10%) combined with a first N application following recommendations resulted in the highest average S1 factor loading. The S1 factor loadings for the transplanted micro-plots were significantly lower than those of direct-seeded micro-plots (P B/0.001). Positive S1 factor loadings were only

obtained in fields with a transplanting density of
/20 hills m 2 in the wet season and /40
hills m 2 in the dry season (Fig. 4).

The first two axes of the PCA2 explained 72% of total variance (Table 4). The first axis, explaining 47% of total variability, illustrates the strong correlation between panicle density, straw weight and spikelet density. This axis reflected plant density and yield potential at maturity. The second
axis explained about 25% of variability, representing essentially the variability in filled spikelet
percentage and single grain weight. Yield (transformed data, i.e. margins after removing the
effects of year, variety and season on the averages)
was very well represented on the first axis. Table 6 shows that in both direct-seeded and transplanted
micro-plots, management of the second N application and the level of weed infestation had a significant effect (P B/0.001) on factor loadings
of the first factorial axis of PCA2 (S2). S2 factor
loadings for direct-seeded micro-plots were on average not significantly higher than for transplanted micro-plots (Table 6).

Differences in yield components (margins after removing the effects of year, variety and season on
the averages) between direct-seeded and transplanted plots were quite substantial although yields were similar (Table 7). Transplanted plots
had higher spikelet density than direct-seeded
plots, compensated with slightly lower single grain weight; they had also lower panicle density compensated with higher number of spikelets per
panicle than direct-seeded plots. This lower panicle

density is illustrated by the lower S1 factor loadings at PI. Low S1 factor loadings lead to low S2 factor loadings apart from the wellmanaged plots (weed infestation at maturity B/ 10% area and second N application following recommendation) as shown in Fig. 5.

Well-managed plots in terms of fertilizer and weed management resulted in substantially higher grain yields (increase on average of 2.8 t ha 1, see Table 7). This yield increase in both direct and
transplanted plots was entirely due to an increase in spikelet density linked with an increase in panicle density and/or number of spikelet per panicle. Our results agree well with observations by Haefele et al. (2000) who reported an increase of 2 t ha 1 through improved soil fertility and weed management.

4. Conclusions .

Soil and weather variability had a relatively minor effect on rice yield variability in farmers' fields. Simulation analysis showed that farmers used sowing dates within the window recommended for wet and dry seasons, avoiding spikelet sterility due to cold or heat stress around flowering. Harvest dates were also close to physiological maturity of the rice crop. Yield variability was, therefore, mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season reduced crop growth and increased within-field tiller density variability. Direct seeding resulted in relatively high but strongly variable plant density and more vigorous growth in the vegetative phase than with transplanting. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities at PI, as illustrated by the low S1

factor Loadings in PCA1. Management of the first N split and weed infestation levels had a relatively minor effect on plant stand at PI in transplanted plots, but a very important effect in direct-seeded plots. Management of the second N application and weed infestation levels affected panicle density and the number of spikelets per panicle in both direct-seeded and transplanted plots, but had no effect on single rice grain weight and filled spikelets percentage. Wopereis-Pura et al. (2002) reported benefits from a third N splits in terms of yield and grain quality. None of the farmers in this study applied N in three splits.

Results indicate the importance of good crop management in general in irrigated systems in the Sahel. Yields that are realized in farmers' fields are still far from the potential that can be obtained with the rice cultivars that are being used. Kebbeh et al. (2002) demonstrated that information on improved and integrated crop management (ICM) is crucial to help farmers bridge this yield gap. Increasing fertilizer and herbicide use efficiencies will also reduce losses of N and herbicides to the environment.

Improved and ICM would increase the efficiency of inputs, such as N fertilizer and herbicide and seed quantity used. WARDA and partners have developed improved ICM options for irrigated rice cropping in the Sahel that are within farmers' means, based on farm surveys, and farmer participatory on- and off-station research (Wopereis et al., 2002). For the Senegal River Valley, these options have been summarized in a manual and posters (WARDA and SAED, 2001). These posters are based on RIDEV simulations and are specific to location, crop establishment technique, sowing date and cultivar choice, and can be adapted easily. The posters give a farming calendar with management options for a given site /sowing date /cultivar choice /crop establishment technique combination, and relevant information is given to enable farmers to adapt them according to their means.

However, ICM at the field level is also strongly dependent on the collective organization at the scheme level (Poussin, 1995, 1998; Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Sowing date, crop implantation method, herbicide and fertilizer quantities are not
decided individually and irrigation depends on water allocation rules. IRD and partners have, therefore, developed software that integrates the RIDEV simulation model at the scheme level (Poussin, 2000).

Effect of late nitrogen application on rice yield, grain quality and profitability in the Senegal River valley .

The effect of an additional nitrogen (N) application of 30 kg N ha at booting on rice yield and grain quality was investigated with 30 farmers in the Senegal River valley during the 1997 wet season (WS) and 23 farmers during the 1998 dry season (DS). Rice yields increased significantly as a result of an extra late N application on top of two N-dressings with a total of about 120 kg N ha in farmer fields. Yield gains were about 1.0 t ha during the 1998 DS and about 0.4 t ha during the 1997 WS. Grain quality was improved through a higher milling recovery (3% increase in both seasons) and a higher percentage of head rice (30% higher in the 1997 WS and 60% higher in the 1998 DS). Benefit to cost ratios of the third nitrogen application for farmers ranged from 2.8 in the WS to 5.4 in the DS. Sorting milled rice resulted in net additional benefits for rice millers, especially in the DS, due to a higher head rice ratio. It was concluded that a third N application can raise both yield levels and grain quality in the Senegal River valley, with potential benefits for farmers and rice millers.

1. Introduction .

About 100,000 ha of irrigation schemes have been developed along the Senegal River in Mauritania and Senegal. During the 1998 wet season (WS) (July to December) about 20,000 ha were in use in Senegal and 17,000 ha in Mauritania.

Potential yield (limited by radiation and temperature only) is about 9 t ha-1 for WS sowing in
July and about 9-10 t ha-1 for dry season (DS) sowing in February in the Senegal River delta (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997). Wopereis et al. (1999) showed that yield gaps between potential and actual farmers' yields in the 1997 WS ranged from 1 to 8 t ha-1 in the Senegal River valley. Major biophysical constraints included phosphorus (P) deficient soils, weed competition, relatively low nitrogen (N) application rates and sub-optimal timing of N application. Despite these constraints, fertilizer N use proved highly profitable in irrigated systems in the Sahel (Donovan et al., 1999). * Corresponding author. E-mail Address: P.wopereis@cgiar.org (M.M.

Wopereis et al. (1999) proposed to improve rice productivity and profitability by increasing N recovery (through improved crop management practices) or increasing the amount of N applied. Hafele et al. (2000, 2001) demonstrated the profitability of improved soil fertility and weed management for small and large scale rice farmers in Senegal and Mauritania. Another possibility to raise profitability would be to improve the quality of rice produced. Price differences in Senegal between low and high quality rice are huge. Whole grain American rice is sold in the Senegalese capital Dakar for 380 CFA1 kg-1, whole grain rice imported from India of lower quality (dark color, relative high percentage of impurities) sells for 190 CFA kg-1. Imported broken rice from Vietnam, Thailand, India, Pakistan and Argentina sells for 160-175 CFA kg-1. An estimated 350,000-450,000 t of rice is consumed annually in Senegal, of which 15,000 tons is whole grain rice. The Mauritanian and Senegalese governments consider raising the quality of domestically produced rice as a prerequisite to improve its competitiveness vis a vis imports. In Senegal, the national irrigation and extension authority for the Senegal River valley (SAED) has launched a rice quality program since 1998. Its objective is to increase production and value of locally produced rice.

Most farmers in the Senegal River valley apply N fertilizer only twice, i.e. roughly at the start of tillering and panicle initiation (PI). The quantities applied are often below recommended levels (Wopereis et al., 1999). The Japanese Food Agency (1998) recommended to apply N fertilizer around booting to enhance photosynthesis rate during the grain filling period, leading to a decrease in the percentage of immature grains and an increase in the percentage of whole grains. The objectives of this study were to: (i) explore the effect of a third N application around booting on rice yield and grain quality; and (ii) to determine potential financial benefits of a third N application for farmers and rice millers in the Senegal River valley.

2. Materials and methods .

2.1. Experimental sites and sampling methodologies
Debi and Tiguet (16degrees29 N, 16degrees17 W) are two arid coastal villages in the Senegal River delta. Topography is flat. The soil type is a salic Fluvisol according to FAO soil classification (FAO, 1990), local name Hollalde. Texture is heavy clay. The climate is characterized by a WS (about 200 mm rainfall) from July to September, a cold dry season from October to February and a hot dry season from March to June.

Debi-Tiguet is a modern irrigation scheme of about 1000 ha, cultivated by 400 farmers. Irrigation and drainage structures were constructed in 1996 through Japanese government funding. The irrigation scheme is divided into two areas, i.e. Debi (farmers from the Debi village) and Tiguet (farmers from Tiguet village). These two areas are further subdivided into sections. A trained village technician supervises each section. An extension agent of SAED (Societe National d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des Terres du Delta du Fleuve Senegal et des Vallees du Fleuve Senegal et de la Faleme) advises each village technician on various crop management interventions using RIDEV. RIDEV is a decision support tool developed by WARDA (Dingkuhn, 1997). It advises extension agents and farmers on optimal timing of crop management interventions, i.e. timing of sowing, weeding, fertilizer application, drainage before harvest and harvest.

Rice cultivation and management are autosufficient in terms of seed supply, irrigation and rice grain milling. The mill is managed by the farmers' union of the Debi and Tiguet villages (Moreira, 1999).

We selected 30 farmers in the 1997 WS and 23 in the 1998 DS that participated in previous SAED surveys and followed RIDEV recommendations. Each farmer's field was relatively free of weeds, and had good irrigation and drainage facilities. Farmers applied N fertilizer twice, i.e. at the start of tillering and at PI, following RIDEV timing. Each farmer's plot was divided into two except for some special cases where plots were too 1 The Franc CFA (CFA) is the currency used in Senegal and is pegged to the French Franc and the Euro. The exchange rates to convert CFA are: 100 CFA=1 French franc; 1 euro=6.55957 French francs.
large for the experiment. In such cases, a portion of the farmer's field was divided and marked into two plots. One part, selected at random, was left as farmers' practice (T0). A third nitrogen application was applied at booting stage at a rate of 30 kg ha-1 (T1) on the other part of the field. Farmers used two rice cultivars (IR1529 and Jaya) during the 1997 WS, and exclusively IR13240-108-2-2-3 (released as Sahel 108 in Senegal in 1994) during the 1998 DS. All rice was direct-seeded.

Harvesting was done at physiological maturity from a 6 m2 sampling area at three sites within each plot. Grain yield was adjusted to 14% moisture content. Yield components were estimated from a sampling area of 0.30 m2 repeated three times within each plot. Threshing was completed 2 weeks after harvest. Grain moisture content was taken at harvest and twice weekly during storage by Kett riceter moisture meter. Temperature and relative humidity of the storage room were recorded periodically. Grain samples from the 1997 WS were analyzed in June 1998 and grain samples from the 1998 DS were analyzed by the end of October 1998 in WARDA's grain quality laboratory in Ndiaye, Senegal. WS samples were stored for 7 months. DS samples were stored for only 4 months.
2.2. Grain quality analysis
Each grain sample was processed as follows. Grain moisture content was measured before husking using a Kett PM 600 moisture meter for 1997 WS samples, and a Kett PM 700 m for the 1998 DS samples. Test weight of paddy (a measure of the fullness of grains) for the 1997 WS were taken directly from measurements made with the Kett PM 600 moisture meter. Test weight for 1998 DS samples were derived from the weight of 240 ml paddy in grams divided by 240 ml and multiplied by 1000. Three measurements were made for each sample.

Husking recovery was measured by husking 300 gram of paddy and dividing resulting brown rice weight in grams by 300 and multiplying by 100%. Brown rice thickness was determined by passing
100 g of brown rice through 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9 mm sieves. Brown rice was calculated as the sum of brown rice weight in grams multiplied by the corresponding sieve width used, divided by 100 g. Composition of brown rice was determined from a 20 g brown rice sample. Complete, dead (including damaged and discolored grains), green and broken (less than 2/3 length of complete grains) grains were separated manually. The percentage of cracked brown rice was measured by counting the number of cracked grains through a Kett mirror reflector tray. For the grain hardness test, 50 brown rice grains were tested using a grain rigidity (hardness) tester Kiya type no. 140.

Milling recovery was measured by milling 150 g brown rice using a Yamamoto vertical type laboratory rice mill (VP 31T) and calculating the weight of milled rice in grams divided by 150 gram, and multiplying by 100%. Twenty gram milled rice was separated manually in head rice (including grains with more than 2/3 length of whole grains), large (grains between head rice and small broken) and small broken (grains that passed through a mesh of 2x2 mm2), and damaged (by insects or disease) grains. Rice grain whiteness was measured using a whiteness tester Kett C-300.

Grain nitrogen content was measured by standard macro-Kjeldahl procedure. Grain protein content was calculated by multiplying grain nitrogen content by 5.95, the nitrogen-protein conversion factor (Yasui and Tsutsumi, 1982).

Statistical analysis was done using Statistica and SPSS. Analysis was done by season and by variety.
2.3. Calculating benefits from late N application
The additional costs of applying a third split of 30 kg N ha-1 were based on: (a) urea price of 9000 CFA per bag of 50 kg; (b) transport costs of 200 CFA per bag of 50 kg; (c) additional labor costs for the third fertilizer application of 1000 CFA ha-1; (d) an interest rate of 12% for the 1997 WS and 7.5% for the 1998 DS; and (e) additional harvest costs due to increased yield, i.e. calculated as 10% of additional yield and costs of
extra bags. Additional benefits for farmers were calculated as the yield difference between T1 and T0 multiplied by a paddy price of 100 CFA kg-1. Net benefits were determined as additional benefits minus total additional costs. Benefit cost ratios of late N application was determined as additional benefits divided by additional costs.

Potential financial returns of high quality paddy as a result of late N application for rice millers were determined as well. Price ranges for different rice qualities were taken from SIMRIZ (Senegal government rice market management and survey unit) weekly market surveys. For this study, prices were taken from the survey conducted during the first week of August 1998 in St. Louis (closest large rice market from Debi-Tiguet, at a distance of about 80 km). Non-aromatic broken rice prices fluctuated between 180 and 225 CFA kg-1. Non-aromatic head rice minimum prices were between 360 and 380 CFA kg-1.

We used the minimum price of non-aromatic broken and head rice to calculate benefits for rice millers assuming they sell 1 t of milled rice from a farmers' field (T0) and 1 t of milled rice from a field where a third split of 30 kg N ha-1 was applied at booting (T1) for both sorted (in head rice and brokens) and nonsorted rice. Sorting was assumed to be performed manually at a cost of 3000 CFA t-1.

Farmers' sowing dates ranged from 14 to 31 July for the WS and from 3 to 11 March in the DS. Total N applied in the T0 plots during the WS was 116 kg N ha-1 and for the DS 127 kg N ha-1. Farmers applied the first N split (a mixture of di-ammonium phosphate and urea) on average at 27 days after sowing (DAS), and the second split (urea only) at 61 DAS during the WS, and at 30 and 63 DAS during the DS. The third nitrogen application of 30 kg N ha-1 as urea in the T1 plots was applied on average at 75 DAS during the 1997 WS and at 79 DAS during the DS. Harvesting time ranged from 110 to 124 DAS during the WS (average: at 117 DAS) and from 118 to 132 DAS (average 125 DAS) for the DS.

3. Results and discussions .

3.1. Farmers' crop management practices
Average WS T0 yield was high, i.e. 7.3 ha-1 (ranging from 5.0 to 9.4 t ha-1), considering the region's potential yield of about 9 t ha-1. Yield gain due to the third N application was relatively small, i.e. about 0.4 t ha-1, but statistically significant. There were some varietal differences with slightly higher yields for IR1529 as compared to Jaya. Average DS T0 yield was relatively low, i.e. 4.4 t ha-1 (ranging from 2.5 to 6.0 t ha-1), due to poor water control and weed infestation. The yield gain due to the third N application was important, i.e. almost 1 t ha-1 and statistically significant. Yield component analyses showed that there were clear problems with spikelet sterility during the DS (average of 24% as compared to 11% in the WS), partly explaining low DS yields.

The third N application increased husking recovery by 1% in the WS but did not affect husking recovery in the DS. The percentage of green grains in T1 was significantly higher for IR 1529 in the DS and Sahel 108 in the WS (Table 1).

WS samples accumulated some moisture during the first week after harvest. Moisture content (MC) increased by about 1%, from 17 to 18% MC and declined sharply afterwards to 13% MC at 35 days after harvest (DAH). From 35 DAH onwards, grain moisture content decreased in an erratic way to about 12% MC, caused by rapid changes in temperature and relative humidity in the storage area. Storage conditions during the 1998 DS were more homogeneous and grain moisture content declined more gradually, i.e. from 19 to 14% MC in 110 days.

Although test weight and grain thickness did not increase significantly in T1, husking recovery increased in both varieties in WS (Table 1). This was likely brought by later maturity caused by late N application. Cracked grain content decreased remarkably in T1 except in Sahel 108. Cracked grain content was 10 times higher during the WS as compared to the DS (Table 1). This may be due to longer storage time of the WS samples (7 months as opposed to 4 months for the DS samples) and the abrupt changes in relative

humidity and temperature during storage. Rice grain quality was significantly improved by the third N application (Table 2). Milling recovery increased by 3% in both seasons. Head rice ratio increased by 12% in the WS and by 24% in the DS. The effect was especially high with IR1529 and Sahel 108. The percentage of large and small broken rice decreased accordingly.

Head rice ratio is affected by various pre- and post-harvest factors. The correlations of head rice ratio with major variables in milling characteristics is summarized in Table 3. Although correlation coefficients are relatively low, some observations can still be made. Milling recovery had the highest value, followed by green grain ratio and complete grain. Higher correlation is seen with percent cracked grain. Green grain ratio is an indicator of rice plant's juvenility, showing that late N application can delay the rice plant's senescence. This improves grain yield and grain quality through lower grain crack ratio and higher head ratio.

Fig. 1 shows that WS head rice ratios declined the more brown rice samples were cracked. WS head rice was significantly different (P=0.004) between treatments (T0=40 and T1=52% head rice). No effect was seen for DS samples as brown rice grains were hardly cracked during this season. Milled rice whiteness was about 2-5% higher for T0 samples as compared to T1 samples across cultivars and seasons because grains broke more easily. Nitrogen content in the grain was higher for the T1 treatment as compared to the T0 treatment (Fig. 2).
3.2. Financial benefits for farmers
Benefit: cost ratios of the third nitrogen application for farmers were relatively high for both seasons. The 1997 WS benefit: cost ratio was 2.8 and the 1998 DS benefit: cost ratio was 5.4 (Table 4). Additional harvest cost were slightly higher in the 1998 DS as compared to the 1997 WS due to the larger yield gain from the third N application. Total additional cost of the third nitrogen appli-
the importance of proper storage. Wet season samples were not stored properly, affecting the percentage of head rice. The percentage of N in the grains was improved through late N application. Farmers and millers in the Senegal River delta can profit from these results to produce high quality rice. To arrive at a quality product, a sequence of activities from sowing to milling should be done correctly. Rice seed quality, weeding, fertilizer applications, timely harvest, proper storage and good mill maintenance will all affect grain quality. Improved interaction between rice miller and rice farmer is crucial to improve grain quality and profitability of irrigated rice production in the Senegal River delta.

4. Conclusions .

A late additional nitrogen application of 30 kg N ha-1 increased yield by about 0.4 t ha-1 during the wet season and by about 1.0 t ha-1 during the dry season. It also improved grain quality (higher head rice ratio) and milling recovery. Farmers can get an additional net benefit of between 30,000 and 80,000 CFA ha-1. Millers can also benefit from a late N application. Head rice ratios increased by 12-24%. Results showed

Determinants of irrigated rice yield in the Senegal River valley .

Determinants of irrigated rice yield were studied in 45 rice fields in the Senegal River valley during 2 years in both wet and dry growing seasons. Grain yields were highly variable, ranging from 0 to 9.5 t ha , with an average yield over years and seasons of 5 t ha , indicating an average yield gap of about 4 /5 t ha 1 between actual farmers' yields and potential yields. Soil P and K status of farmers' fields were mostly above critical limits and pH and electrical conductivity values were in the optimal range for irrigated rice. Average yield levels for three out of the four seasons were not significantly different. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season induced slower development rate and lower above-ground biomass despite higher plant and tiller density at panicle initiation (PI). Analysis of growth cycle and spikelet sterility levels in the sample fields using the RIDEV simulation model showed that yield losses due to cold or heat stress around flowering could be neglected. Yield variability was, therefore, assumed to be mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. Plant density in the dry season was significantly higher than in the wet season in both transplanted and direct-seeded fields, with farmers compensating for retarded growth at the onset of the dry season due to cold temperatures. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities determined at PI. Principal component analyses conducted with three variables, i.e. plant density, tiller density and rice*/above-ground dry weight determined at PI and yield components at maturity allowed to determine the effect of crop management. Sub-optimal weed and N fertilizer management were major factors driving yield variability in farmers' fields. Increasing the productivity of irrigated rice will require collective action at both field and scheme level. # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. all rights reserved.

1. Introduction .

Senegal is one of the countries in West Africa that rely to a large extent on imports to face a growing demand for rice ( /600 000 t year 1). Domestic production covers only about 20% of this demand, of which most is produced in the * Corresponding author. Tel.: /33-467-14-9031; Fax: /33- 467-14-9068.

Senegal River Valley, from a surface area that ranges from 25 000 to 35 000 ha Year 1. Until the
late 1980s, the local irrigation authority SAED (Societe Nationale d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des terres du Delta et des vallees du fleuve
Senegal et de la Faleme) was responsible for the development of irrigation in Senegal. SAED
managed irrigation and drainage infrastructure,
land preparation, purchase of inputs, and bought paddy at subsidized prices (Le Gal and Dia, 1991).

In 1987, SAED withdrew from the rice production process. Since 1994, all rice irrigation schemes
have been privatized and most irrigation schemes
are now managed by farmer organizations.

Double cropping (growing rice in the wet and dry seasons on the same field) is possible, but
hardly practised in the Senegal River valley (Le
Gal and Papy, 1998). The potential grain yield that can be obtained ranges from 8 to 9 t ha 1 in the wet season (July sowing) and from 6 to 11 t ha 1
in the dry season (February sowing). Potential yields generally decline moving inland because of
heat stress at flowering (Dingkuhn and Sow,
1997). Farmers' yields are on average between 4 and 5 t ha 1, and, therefore, far below potential
yields. Crop management practices among farmers
are highly variable (Poussin, 1995, 1998), especially as far as weed and fertilizer management is
concerned (Diallo and Johnson, 1997; Wopereis et
al., 1999; Haefele et al., 2000).

Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley often need rehabilitation because of land leveling problems and poor condition of irrigation canals. Land preparation is mostly done under dry soil conditions, usually with a disk plow. The resulting seedbed is often uneven with large soil clods (Kante, 1996).

Farmers rarely buy certified seeds. Almost 50% of rice area is sown with seed retained from the previous harvest (Poussin, 1997; Belieres et al., 1997). In the Senegal River delta, the majority of the farmers direct seed rice rather than transplant the crop. Moving inland, transplanting becomes more and more important.

Weed infestation is one of the most important factors reducing rice yields in Senegal (SAED, 1997; Haefele et al., 2000). Yield losses of between 30 and 90% were observed in direct-seeded rice and up to 40% in transplanted rice (Diallo and Johnson, 1997). Haefele et al. (2000) demonstrated that benefits from improved weed control were in the order of 1 t ha 1 or almost 25% above farmers' practice. The most common herbicides are propanil and 2,4-D amine, mostly mixed before spraying. The dosage applied (average of 4.6 and 1.5 l ha 1, respectively; Belieres et al., 1997) are close to recommended doses (6 and 1 l ha 1, respectively). Farmers often delay herbicide application until weeds are impeding rice growth (Haefele et al., 2000), resulting in poor weed control.

J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356342
SAED recommends farmers to apply fertilizer in three splits. The first is a basal application of 100 kg ha 1 of diammonium-phosphate (DAP, containing 18% N and 20% P). The second consists of 100 kg urea (46% N) at the start of tillering for direct seeding, or after the transplanting shock in case of transplanting. The third application consists of 100 kg urea ha 1 at panicle initiation (PI), i.e. at about 1 month after the second split. In practice, farmers rarely apply fertilizers in three applications. Because of late arrival of fertilizers and because farmers want to avoid that weeds profit from basal fertilizer, DAP is often mixed with urea and applied at the start of tillering (Wopereis et al., 1999). Fertilizer use is generally profitable in Sahelian West Africa (Donovan et al., 1999). Soil salinity is very pronounced in the delta of the Senegal River, but salinity levels decrease moving inland (Wopereis et al., 1998).

The objective of this paper is to shed more light on the importance of soil and weather variability and crop management on yield formation in farmers' fields under irrigation in the Senegal River valley.

2. Materials and methods .

2.1. Site description and surveys
The surveys were conducted in the region of Podor (16840?N, 158W), situated in the Senegal River middle valley, about 200 km east of the mouth of the Senegal River (see map in Fig. 1). Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley have been mostly installed on heavy clay (i.e. arid Vertisol, Soil Survey Staff, 1981), locally known as Hollalde or Faux-Hollalde. The first rice crop is sown during the hot dry season (mostly in February) and the second crop during the wet season (mostly in July). Late sowing in the wet season results in a risk of spikelet sterility due to cold in November (Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Air temperatures in February to March are relatively low, slowing down crop development in the dry season. From May to June, hot and dry winds around flowering may cause spikelet sterility (Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Rice fields are flooded
for 100 /120 days during each growth cycle. Irrigation water from the Senegal River is supplied to the field by floating pumps. The potential yield level that can be obtained in Podor with July sowing in the wet season and February sowing in the dry season is about 8 /9 t ha 1 (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997).

Our sample included 45 rice fields cultivated by 11 farmers in 11 irrigation schemes in the Podor region. The survey included 9 fields in the 1994 dry season, 17 fields in the 1994 wet season, 6 fields in the 1995 dry season and 13 fields in the 1995 wet season. Farmers used four indica cultivars: Aiwu (short duration, slender grain), I Kong Pao (short duration, bold grain) and IR1529 and Jaya (medium duration, slender grain). Out of the 45 fields, 27 were transplanted and 18 direct-seeded. Each farmer cultivated various fields in the area in different irrigation schemes and used sometimes more than one crop establishment method. One to four (the exact number depending on field size) 16 m2 micro-plots were installed in each farmer field, yielding 18 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season, 38 in the 1994 wet season, 14 in the 1995 dry season and 28 in the 1995 wet season. On this total of 98 micro-plots, 4 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season, 6 in the 1995 dry season and 1 in the 1995 wet season had no panicles at all at maturity, leaving a total of 87 plots with harvested yield.

2.2. Soil analyses .

The topsoil (0 /0.2 m depth) from all fields was sampled before the onset of the growing season (one composite sample from 5 samples taken at random per field). Soil analyses (P-Olsen, pH, electrical conductivity, CEC and exchangeable K) were conducted in the IRD laboratory in Dakar, Senegal following standard methodologies.

2.3. Fertilizer and weed management practices .

Weed management (mode, dosage, timing and type of herbicide used if any) was monitored for each field. Visual scores of weed infestation were taken at PI and maturity. Three classes of surface area coverage by weeds were distinguished: less than 10%; between 10 and 30%; and more than
J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356 343
30%. These visual estimates were calibrated by estimating oven-dry weight (2 days, 70 8C) of above-ground weed biomass in 25 micro-plots, taking four 0.32 m2 samples per micro-plot, using 0.64 m diameter rings.

Fertilizer management (timing and dosage of fertilizer application) was also monitored. Data obtained for each fertilizer application and farmer were grouped into five classes:
i) timely application, sufficient dosage ( /50
kg N ha 1); ii) timely application, insufficient dosage (B/50
kg N ha 1);
iii) late application, sufficient dosage ( /50
kg N ha 1);
iv) late application, insufficient dosage (B/50
kg N ha 1); and
v) no N application.
2.4. Crop establishment, development and yield components
Four 0.32 m2 samples were taken at PI and maturity using 0.64 m diameter rings placed at random in each micro-plot. At PI, the canopy structure was determinated from the number of plants, number of tillers, and oven-dry weight (2 days at 70 8C) of above-ground rice biomass per unit area. At maturity, rice grain yield (corrected for 14% moisture) and yield components were determined. Yield components included panicle number, spikelet number, straw weight (oven-dry weight of rice green and dead biomass) per unit area, and filled spikelet percentage, and the average weight of one single rice grain (in mg, corrected for 14% moisture) determined from 1000 grains.

2.5. Crop modeling .

The RIDEV model (Dingkuhn et al., 1995b; Dingkuhn, 1997) was used to determine best periods for rice cropping in both growing seasons. The model uses daily minimum and maximum air temperatures, sowing date, variety-specific photothermal constants and crop establishment method as inputs. Outputs are growth duration and
spikelet sterility due to cold stress (mainly in the wet season, but cold may also affect early sowing in the dry season) and heat stress (exclusively during the dry season). Simulations were conducted year-round, using 14 years of weather data from the Podor region for direct-seeded I Kong Pao, a short-duration rice cultivar widely grown in the region in 1994 and 1995. Spikelet sterility percentages were also determined for actual farmer sowing dates and varietal choice using 1994 and 1995 weather data from Podor to investigate if in some cases heat or cold stress affected farmer yields.

2.6. Statistical analyses .

Data analysis first allowed to estimate the effect of year, season and cultivar on yield formation. We subsequently removed these effects through data transformation to analyze the effect of crop management (weeding and N fertilization), regardless of season, year or cultivar.

For each plant variable measured at maturity, the effects of three factors, i.e. year (with two terms: 1994 and 1995), cultivar (with four terms: Aiwu, I Kong Pao, IR1529, Jaya) and season (with two terms: dry season and wet season) were estimated and subsequently removed through within-group reduction. For each plant variable and micro-plot i , the average of a given term over all micro-plots was subtracted from the actual value for this term in micro-plot i , yielding the transformed value. For example, for all microplots i with cultivar c , the transformed value Xi equaled the margin between the original value Xi and the average of X for all micro-plots i with cultivar c . At PI, only the effect of season was removed through normalization (cropping season had an effect on the averages and standard deviations). For each plant variable and microplot i , the average of a given term over all microplots was subtracted from the actual value for the term in micro-plot i , and the result was divided by the standard deviation of the term. For example, for all micro-plots i cropped in the dry season, the transformed value Xi equaled the margin between the original value Xi and the average of X for all micro-plots i cropped in dry season, divided by the
J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356344
standard deviation of X for all micro-plots i cropped in dry season. These transformations can be made under the hypothesis that no interaction exists between the effects (Doledec and Chessel, 1987, 1989).

Two principal component analyses were conducted using the transformed data. The first principal component analysis (PCA1) was conducted for the variables plant density, tiller density and above-ground biomass measured at PI. The factorial axis of PCA1 reflected the canopy architecture measured in the fields at PI. The second analysis (PCA2) included panicle density, straw weight, spikelet density, filled spikelets percentage and single grain weight measured at maturity. Yield was introduced as a supplementary variable in the PCA2 to evaluate the weight of each factorial axis in explaining its variability. The factorial axis of PCA2 reflected the yield structure at maturity. We used software package ADE-4 (Thioulouse et al., 1996).

The effects of crop installation (direct seeding or transplanting) and management (weeding and N fertilizer) were measured on the factor loadings of PCA1 and PCA2 through ANOVA.

3. Results and discussion .

3.1. Effects of soil variability
Soil analyses showed that P Olsen ranged from 5.9 to 32 mg kg 1, with an average of 15.1
mg kg 1. Dobermann et al. (1995) reported critical levels for Olsen plant available P from 4 to 29 mg kg 1. The range of critical levels reported in literature for K availability in rice soils is between 0.1 and 0.4 cmol kg soil 1 (Dobermann et al., 1995). In our fields, exchangeable K values varied from 0.2 to 1.2 cmol kg 1. CEC ranged from 10 to 32 cmol kg 1 and were strongly correlated with clay content (r2 /0.857). CEC may affect availability of micro-nutrients, but no signs of deficiency were observed in any field. Soil texture has an influence on soil-water status, but all fields were well-watered and drought stress did not occur in harvested plots. The pH of the topsoil varied between 5.1 and 7.5. Electrical conductivity (EC) values ranged from 0.02 to 0.23 mS cm 1. These values do not constitute a constraint to irrigated rice cropping (Asch and Wopereis, 2000). We assumed, therefore, that initial soil P and K status and soil salinity levels were not hampering rice growth.
3.2. Effects of weather variability
Rice grain yields ranged from 0 to 9.5 Mg ha 1 (Table 1), with an average yield of 5 t ha 1 over both years and seasons. Yields may have been over-estimated somewhat due to the relatively small size of the micro-plots. The average yield gap between potential yields and farmers' yields was, therefore, about 4 /5 Mg ha 1. Three fields were not harvested in the 1995 dry season and one field in the 1994 dry season due to extensive bird

damage and breakdown of pumps. Only 1994 dry season yields were statistically different from the
other seasons (Table 1). Yield components are
shown per cultivar and season in Table 2. Panicle density was significantly higher, and filled sterility
percentage and single grain weight significantly
lower in the dry season as compared to the wet season (P B/0.0001). Differences in other yield
components were not significantly different.

RIDEV-simulated year-round variability of spikelet sterility and growth duration using Podor
weather data (Fig. 2) are shown in Fig. 3. If one
would accept an average spikelet sterility of 15% or less (this percentage can be greater than 30% in
a specific year), it would be best to sow I Kong Pao in Podor between 7 December and 3 September. If this percentage may not exceed 30% in any year (the maximum spikelet sterility must still be lower than 30%), the most favorable periods are from 22 December to 1 January, from 31 January to 22 February and from 22 March to 24 August. January sowing may lead to flowering in April, when temperatures are still relatively low, in some years leading to spikelet sterility due to cold. February and March sowing may lead to flowering in May to early June, when temperatures are very high, which may lead to spikelet sterility due to heat. For transplanting, these best sowing periods need to be moved forward by 10 /15 days.

At the scheme level, the first two sowing periods (from 22 December to 1 January and from 31 January to 22 February) are too short to sow all the fields. Therefore, the favorable sowing period is from the end of March to the end of August, i.e. about 5 months. The average growth duration in the dry season is about 4 months (Fig. 3), leaving only 1 month to prepare the field for the next crop on the same field. Double cropping requires good collective organization at the scheme scale (Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Farmers will often prefer to grow two crops on different fields or schemes.

RIDEV simulations using actual sowing dates of sample farmers showed that sowing dates were well chosen. Only 1 farmer may have experienced a 10% spikelet sterility problem in the 1995 wet season. The relatively low filled spikelet percentage values in Table 2 are, therefore, due to grain filling problems, and not spikelet sterility.

Yield losses due to late harvesting could not be analyzed in this study as all micro-plots were harvested at physiological maturity. Farmers harvested their fields shortly after physiological maturity in the dry seasons of 1994 and 1995. During the wet seasons of 1994 and 1995 they harvested their fields about 15 days after physiological maturity.

The canopy architecture measured at PI significantly differed (P B/0.0001) in the dry and wet seasons for both crop establishment methods (Table 3). Cold temperatures during crop establishment in the dry season induced lower levels of above-ground biomass and slower development

with higher level of tillering. Farmers compensated for these harsher conditions by using a higher density of sowing or transplanting in the dry season as compared to the wet season.

3.3. Effects of crop management other than choice
of sowing and harvest dates .

3.3.1. Crop establishment .

All farmers used pre-germinated seed, however, the large majority of farmers did not use certified seeds. In direct-seeded fields, between 80 and 200 kg ha 1 was applied, i.e. about 380 /950 grains m 2. Plant density measured at PI was 265 plants m 2, i.e. less than half of the density of seeds sown. Plant density was higher in the dry season than in the wet season. Farmers increased their sowing densities to compensate mortality induced by cold during emergence. Plant density was very variable, both within and between fields. Poor seed quality and poor land preparation and leveling explain the low ratio of plant density over seed density. The variability between fields is related to the use of different seeding rates, but differences in weed infestation levels were also important. The variability of densities was greater in the dry season than in the wet season. Cold temperatures at the onset of rice development increased the effects of variability in emergence conditions (seed quality, land preparation, weed infestation).

Farmers transplanted relatively old seedlings. Seedling age varied from 21 to 42 days (average 32 days) in the wet season and from 26 to 49 days (average 38 days) in the dry season. The number of hills per m2 was substantially greater in the dry season (36) as compared to the wet season (19). Like in direct-seeded fields, farmers compensated for cold at the onset of the dry season by transplanting a higher number of seedlings per hill, and a higher number of hills per m2. The number of seedlings per hill was relatively high, i.e. 3.8 in the wet season and 4.6 in the dry season. Farmers explained that they prefer older seedlings because they are taller and can support higher levels of water in the field. However, older seedlings suffer from prolonged transplanting
shock, reducing tillering capacity (Dingkuhn et al., 1990).

3.3.2. Weed management .

Calibration of visual weed estimates showed that a weed surface cover of less than 10% corresponded to between 0 and 24 g dry weed biomass m 2. A surface cover between 10 and 30% corresponded to a weed biomass between 13 and 228 g m 2, and a cover of more than 30% corresponded to a biomass greater than 130 g m 2. Weed infestation was more pronounced and intervened earlier in the growth cycle in directseeded fields, and weed pressure was higher at the end of the cycle than at PI. At PI, high levels of weed infestation (weed cover /10% of the area) was observed in 33 out the 50 direct-seeded plots and only 11 out the 37 transplanted plots. At maturity, low levels of weed infestation (weed cover B/10% of the area) concerned only 7 direct-seeded plots vs. 17 transplanted plots.

In direct-seeded fields weed control was mainly chemical. Only 1 field did not receive any herbicide. The large majority of farmers used postemergence herbicides. These herbicides require field drainage and should ideally be applied at the 2 /3 leaf stages of weeds. These conditions were, however, rarely followed, as was also observed by Le Gal et al. (1990), Diagne (1995), Diallo and Johnson (1997). The dosage applied was smaller than recommended in 18 out of the 22 fields treated with herbicides. Some farmers hand weeded at tillering stage, however none hand weeded prior to the second N application, which explains the increase in weed biomass towards maturity. In the transplanted fields, 14 out of the 17 fields were treated with pre- or post-emergence herbicides at rates below recommended levels. Only 2 farmers hand weeded before the second N split, and weed biomass increased towards maturity.

3.3.3. Nitrogen fertilizer management .

The average total amount of N applied was 141 kg ha 1 and 33 out of the 45 fields received more than 100 kg ha 1. The average total amount of P applied was 23 kg ha 1 and 34 fields received less than 20 kg ha 1.

J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356 349
In the 27 direct-seeded fields, 10 fields received only 1 split, 7 early in the growth cycle, and 3 late. The first split was applied at the recommended development stage (start of tillering) and at the recommended dosage ( /50 kg ha 1) in 15 fields. The second split was applied at the recommended stage (PI) in 18 fields, but the dosage was below the recommended level (B/50 kg ha 1) in 6 fields. Only 8 farmers followed all recommendations for N application. The majority of farmers that followed recommendations for the first split, also did so for the second N application.

The 18 transplanted fields received all two splits of N, and all farmers applied N to their rice seedling nurseries. The first split in the main field was applied at the recommended development stage (after transplanting shock) and at the recommended dosage in only six fields. The second split was applied at the recommended time in 16 fields, but only three farmers applied 50 kg N ha 1 or more.

Generally, farmers followed recommendations as far as N dosage and number of splits was concerned, but they did not follow recommended application dates. Similar observations were made elsewhere in West Africa (Becker and Johnson, 1999; Wopereis et al., 1999) and Asia (Singh et al., 1995; Cassman et al., 1997). Transplanted fields were generally better followed than direct-seeded fields. The second split was applied at the recommended stage and at the recommended dosage in the majority of cases. N fertilization of the seedling
nursery will have compensated for late application of the first N split, or application of a relatively low dosage. Weed infestation levels were lower in transplanted fields at the beginning of the growth cycle, and N application will, therefore, have been more effective in these fields.

3.3.4. Principal component analyses .

The first axis (S1) of the PCA1 explained 80% of the variability observed (Table 4), indicating a strong correlation between plant density, tiller density and above-ground biomass at PI. S1 measures plant stand and growth at PI. Table 5 shows the effect of weed infestation at PI combined with N management (first application) on the S1 factor loadings. In the direct-seeded plots, management of the first N application had a significant effect on the S1 factor loadings (P B/ 0.01). Negative factor loadings were found if recommendations on the first N application were not followed, and positive factor loadings if the recommendations were followed. For transplanted plots, management of the first N application did not have a significant effect on S1 factor loadings. For both direct-seeded and transplanted microplots, good weed management (weed cover B/ 10%) combined with a first N application following recommendations resulted in the highest average S1 factor loading. The S1 factor loadings for the transplanted micro-plots were significantly lower than those of direct-seeded micro-plots (P B/0.001). Positive S1 factor loadings were only

obtained in fields with a transplanting density of
/20 hills m 2 in the wet season and /40
hills m 2 in the dry season (Fig. 4).

The first two axes of the PCA2 explained 72% of total variance (Table 4). The first axis, explaining 47% of total variability, illustrates the strong correlation between panicle density, straw weight and spikelet density. This axis reflected plant density and yield potential at maturity. The second
axis explained about 25% of variability, representing essentially the variability in filled spikelet
percentage and single grain weight. Yield (transformed data, i.e. margins after removing the
effects of year, variety and season on the averages)
was very well represented on the first axis. Table 6 shows that in both direct-seeded and transplanted
micro-plots, management of the second N application and the level of weed infestation had a significant effect (P B/0.001) on factor loadings
of the first factorial axis of PCA2 (S2). S2 factor
loadings for direct-seeded micro-plots were on average not significantly higher than for transplanted micro-plots (Table 6).

Differences in yield components (margins after removing the effects of year, variety and season on
the averages) between direct-seeded and transplanted plots were quite substantial although yields were similar (Table 7). Transplanted plots
had higher spikelet density than direct-seeded
plots, compensated with slightly lower single grain weight; they had also lower panicle density compensated with higher number of spikelets per
panicle than direct-seeded plots. This lower panicle

density is illustrated by the lower S1 factor loadings at PI. Low S1 factor loadings lead to low S2 factor loadings apart from the wellmanaged plots (weed infestation at maturity B/ 10% area and second N application following recommendation) as shown in Fig. 5.

Well-managed plots in terms of fertilizer and weed management resulted in substantially higher grain yields (increase on average of 2.8 t ha 1, see Table 7). This yield increase in both direct and
transplanted plots was entirely due to an increase in spikelet density linked with an increase in panicle density and/or number of spikelet per panicle. Our results agree well with observations by Haefele et al. (2000) who reported an increase of 2 t ha 1 through improved soil fertility and weed management.

4. Conclusions .

Soil and weather variability had a relatively minor effect on rice yield variability in farmers' fields. Simulation analysis showed that farmers used sowing dates within the window recommended for wet and dry seasons, avoiding spikelet sterility due to cold or heat stress around flowering. Harvest dates were also close to physiological maturity of the rice crop. Yield variability was, therefore, mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season reduced crop growth and increased within-field tiller density variability. Direct seeding resulted in relatively high but strongly variable plant density and more vigorous growth in the vegetative phase than with transplanting. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities at PI, as illustrated by the low S1

factor Loadings in PCA1. Management of the first N split and weed infestation levels had a relatively minor effect on plant stand at PI in transplanted plots, but a very important effect in direct-seeded plots. Management of the second N application and weed infestation levels affected panicle density and the number of spikelets per panicle in both direct-seeded and transplanted plots, but had no effect on single rice grain weight and filled spikelets percentage. Wopereis-Pura et al. (2002) reported benefits from a third N splits in terms of yield and grain quality. None of the farmers in this study applied N in three splits.

Results indicate the importance of good crop management in general in irrigated systems in the Sahel. Yields that are realized in farmers' fields are still far from the potential that can be obtained with the rice cultivars that are being used. Kebbeh et al. (2002) demonstrated that information on improved and integrated crop management (ICM) is crucial to help farmers bridge this yield gap. Increasing fertilizer and herbicide use efficiencies will also reduce losses of N and herbicides to the environment.

Improved and ICM would increase the efficiency of inputs, such as N fertilizer and herbicide and seed quantity used. WARDA and partners have developed improved ICM options for irrigated rice cropping in the Sahel that are within farmers' means, based on farm surveys, and farmer participatory on- and off-station research (Wopereis et al., 2002). For the Senegal River Valley, these options have been summarized in a manual and posters (WARDA and SAED, 2001). These posters are based on RIDEV simulations and are specific to location, crop establishment technique, sowing date and cultivar choice, and can be adapted easily. The posters give a farming calendar with management options for a given site /sowing date /cultivar choice /crop establishment technique combination, and relevant information is given to enable farmers to adapt them according to their means.

However, ICM at the field level is also strongly dependent on the collective organization at the scheme level (Poussin, 1995, 1998; Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Sowing date, crop implantation method, herbicide and fertilizer quantities are not
decided individually and irrigation depends on water allocation rules. IRD and partners have, therefore, developed software that integrates the RIDEV simulation model at the scheme level (Poussin, 2000).

Determinants of irrigated rice yield in the Senegal River valley .

Determinants of irrigated rice yield were studied in 45 rice fields in the Senegal River valley during 2 years in both wet and dry growing seasons. Grain yields were highly variable, ranging from 0 to 9.5 t ha , with an average yield over years and seasons of 5 t ha , indicating an average yield gap of about 4 /5 t ha 1 between actual farmers' yields and potential yields. Soil P and K status of farmers' fields were mostly above critical limits and pH and electrical conductivity values were in the optimal range for irrigated rice. Average yield levels for three out of the four seasons were not significantly different. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season induced slower development rate and lower above-ground biomass despite higher plant and tiller density at panicle initiation (PI). Analysis of growth cycle and spikelet sterility levels in the sample fields using the RIDEV simulation model showed that yield losses due to cold or heat stress around flowering could be neglected. Yield variability was, therefore, assumed to be mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. Plant density in the dry season was significantly higher than in the wet season in both transplanted and direct-seeded fields, with farmers compensating for retarded growth at the onset of the dry season due to cold temperatures. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities determined at PI. Principal component analyses conducted with three variables, i.e. plant density, tiller density and rice*/above-ground dry weight determined at PI and yield components at maturity allowed to determine the effect of crop management. Sub-optimal weed and N fertilizer management were major factors driving yield variability in farmers' fields. Increasing the productivity of irrigated rice will require collective action at both field and scheme level. # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. all rights reserved.

1. Introduction .

Senegal is one of the countries in West Africa that rely to a large extent on imports to face a growing demand for rice ( /600 000 t year 1). Domestic production covers only about 20% of this demand, of which most is produced in the * Corresponding author. Tel.: /33-467-14-9031; Fax: /33- 467-14-9068.

Senegal River Valley, from a surface area that ranges from 25 000 to 35 000 ha Year 1. Until the
late 1980s, the local irrigation authority SAED (Societe Nationale d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des terres du Delta et des vallees du fleuve
Senegal et de la Faleme) was responsible for the development of irrigation in Senegal. SAED
managed irrigation and drainage infrastructure,
land preparation, purchase of inputs, and bought paddy at subsidized prices (Le Gal and Dia, 1991).

In 1987, SAED withdrew from the rice production process. Since 1994, all rice irrigation schemes
have been privatized and most irrigation schemes
are now managed by farmer organizations.

Double cropping (growing rice in the wet and dry seasons on the same field) is possible, but
hardly practised in the Senegal River valley (Le
Gal and Papy, 1998). The potential grain yield that can be obtained ranges from 8 to 9 t ha 1 in the wet season (July sowing) and from 6 to 11 t ha 1
in the dry season (February sowing). Potential yields generally decline moving inland because of
heat stress at flowering (Dingkuhn and Sow,
1997). Farmers' yields are on average between 4 and 5 t ha 1, and, therefore, far below potential
yields. Crop management practices among farmers
are highly variable (Poussin, 1995, 1998), especially as far as weed and fertilizer management is
concerned (Diallo and Johnson, 1997; Wopereis et
al., 1999; Haefele et al., 2000).

Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley often need rehabilitation because of land leveling problems and poor condition of irrigation canals. Land preparation is mostly done under dry soil conditions, usually with a disk plow. The resulting seedbed is often uneven with large soil clods (Kante, 1996).

Farmers rarely buy certified seeds. Almost 50% of rice area is sown with seed retained from the previous harvest (Poussin, 1997; Belieres et al., 1997). In the Senegal River delta, the majority of the farmers direct seed rice rather than transplant the crop. Moving inland, transplanting becomes more and more important.

Weed infestation is one of the most important factors reducing rice yields in Senegal (SAED, 1997; Haefele et al., 2000). Yield losses of between 30 and 90% were observed in direct-seeded rice and up to 40% in transplanted rice (Diallo and Johnson, 1997). Haefele et al. (2000) demonstrated that benefits from improved weed control were in the order of 1 t ha 1 or almost 25% above farmers' practice. The most common herbicides are propanil and 2,4-D amine, mostly mixed before spraying. The dosage applied (average of 4.6 and 1.5 l ha 1, respectively; Belieres et al., 1997) are close to recommended doses (6 and 1 l ha 1, respectively). Farmers often delay herbicide application until weeds are impeding rice growth (Haefele et al., 2000), resulting in poor weed control.

J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356342
SAED recommends farmers to apply fertilizer in three splits. The first is a basal application of 100 kg ha 1 of diammonium-phosphate (DAP, containing 18% N and 20% P). The second consists of 100 kg urea (46% N) at the start of tillering for direct seeding, or after the transplanting shock in case of transplanting. The third application consists of 100 kg urea ha 1 at panicle initiation (PI), i.e. at about 1 month after the second split. In practice, farmers rarely apply fertilizers in three applications. Because of late arrival of fertilizers and because farmers want to avoid that weeds profit from basal fertilizer, DAP is often mixed with urea and applied at the start of tillering (Wopereis et al., 1999). Fertilizer use is generally profitable in Sahelian West Africa (Donovan et al., 1999). Soil salinity is very pronounced in the delta of the Senegal River, but salinity levels decrease moving inland (Wopereis et al., 1998).

The objective of this paper is to shed more light on the importance of soil and weather variability and crop management on yield formation in farmers' fields under irrigation in the Senegal River valley.

2. Materials and methods .

2.1. Site description and surveys
The surveys were conducted in the region of Podor (16840?N, 158W), situated in the Senegal River middle valley, about 200 km east of the mouth of the Senegal River (see map in Fig. 1). Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley have been mostly installed on heavy clay (i.e. arid Vertisol, Soil Survey Staff, 1981), locally known as Hollalde or Faux-Hollalde. The first rice crop is sown during the hot dry season (mostly in February) and the second crop during the wet season (mostly in July). Late sowing in the wet season results in a risk of spikelet sterility due to cold in November (Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Air temperatures in February to March are relatively low, slowing down crop development in the dry season. From May to June, hot and dry winds around flowering may cause spikelet sterility (Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Rice fields are flooded
for 100 /120 days during each growth cycle. Irrigation water from the Senegal River is supplied to the field by floating pumps. The potential yield level that can be obtained in Podor with July sowing in the wet season and February sowing in the dry season is about 8 /9 t ha 1 (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997).

Our sample included 45 rice fields cultivated by 11 farmers in 11 irrigation schemes in the Podor region. The survey included 9 fields in the 1994 dry season, 17 fields in the 1994 wet season, 6 fields in the 1995 dry season and 13 fields in the 1995 wet season. Farmers used four indica cultivars: Aiwu (short duration, slender grain), I Kong Pao (short duration, bold grain) and IR1529 and Jaya (medium duration, slender grain). Out of the 45 fields, 27 were transplanted and 18 direct-seeded. Each farmer cultivated various fields in the area in different irrigation schemes and used sometimes more than one crop establishment method. One to four (the exact number depending on field size) 16 m2 micro-plots were installed in each farmer field, yielding 18 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season, 38 in the 1994 wet season, 14 in the 1995 dry season and 28 in the 1995 wet season. On this total of 98 micro-plots, 4 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season, 6 in the 1995 dry season and 1 in the 1995 wet season had no panicles at all at maturity, leaving a total of 87 plots with harvested yield.

2.2. Soil analyses .

The topsoil (0 /0.2 m depth) from all fields was sampled before the onset of the growing season (one composite sample from 5 samples taken at random per field). Soil analyses (P-Olsen, pH, electrical conductivity, CEC and exchangeable K) were conducted in the IRD laboratory in Dakar, Senegal following standard methodologies.

2.3. Fertilizer and weed management practices .

Weed management (mode, dosage, timing and type of herbicide used if any) was monitored for each field. Visual scores of weed infestation were taken at PI and maturity. Three classes of surface area coverage by weeds were distinguished: less than 10%; between 10 and 30%; and more than
J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356 343
30%. These visual estimates were calibrated by estimating oven-dry weight (2 days, 70 8C) of above-ground weed biomass in 25 micro-plots, taking four 0.32 m2 samples per micro-plot, using 0.64 m diameter rings.

Fertilizer management (timing and dosage of fertilizer application) was also monitored. Data obtained for each fertilizer application and farmer were grouped into five classes:
i) timely application, sufficient dosage ( /50
kg N ha 1); ii) timely application, insufficient dosage (B/50
kg N ha 1);
iii) late application, sufficient dosage ( /50
kg N ha 1);
iv) late application, insufficient dosage (B/50
kg N ha 1); and
v) no N application.
2.4. Crop establishment, development and yield components
Four 0.32 m2 samples were taken at PI and maturity using 0.64 m diameter rings placed at random in each micro-plot. At PI, the canopy structure was determinated from the number of plants, number of tillers, and oven-dry weight (2 days at 70 8C) of above-ground rice biomass per unit area. At maturity, rice grain yield (corrected for 14% moisture) and yield components were determined. Yield components included panicle number, spikelet number, straw weight (oven-dry weight of rice green and dead biomass) per unit area, and filled spikelet percentage, and the average weight of one single rice grain (in mg, corrected for 14% moisture) determined from 1000 grains.

2.5. Crop modeling .

The RIDEV model (Dingkuhn et al., 1995b; Dingkuhn, 1997) was used to determine best periods for rice cropping in both growing seasons. The model uses daily minimum and maximum air temperatures, sowing date, variety-specific photothermal constants and crop establishment method as inputs. Outputs are growth duration and
spikelet sterility due to cold stress (mainly in the wet season, but cold may also affect early sowing in the dry season) and heat stress (exclusively during the dry season). Simulations were conducted year-round, using 14 years of weather data from the Podor region for direct-seeded I Kong Pao, a short-duration rice cultivar widely grown in the region in 1994 and 1995. Spikelet sterility percentages were also determined for actual farmer sowing dates and varietal choice using 1994 and 1995 weather data from Podor to investigate if in some cases heat or cold stress affected farmer yields.

2.6. Statistical analyses .

Data analysis first allowed to estimate the effect of year, season and cultivar on yield formation. We subsequently removed these effects through data transformation to analyze the effect of crop management (weeding and N fertilization), regardless of season, year or cultivar.

For each plant variable measured at maturity, the effects of three factors, i.e. year (with two terms: 1994 and 1995), cultivar (with four terms: Aiwu, I Kong Pao, IR1529, Jaya) and season (with two terms: dry season and wet season) were estimated and subsequently removed through within-group reduction. For each plant variable and micro-plot i , the average of a given term over all micro-plots was subtracted from the actual value for this term in micro-plot i , yielding the transformed value. For example, for all microplots i with cultivar c , the transformed value Xi equaled the margin between the original value Xi and the average of X for all micro-plots i with cultivar c . At PI, only the effect of season was removed through normalization (cropping season had an effect on the averages and standard deviations). For each plant variable and microplot i , the average of a given term over all microplots was subtracted from the actual value for the term in micro-plot i , and the result was divided by the standard deviation of the term. For example, for all micro-plots i cropped in the dry season, the transformed value Xi equaled the margin between the original value Xi and the average of X for all micro-plots i cropped in dry season, divided by the
J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356344
standard deviation of X for all micro-plots i cropped in dry season. These transformations can be made under the hypothesis that no interaction exists between the effects (Doledec and Chessel, 1987, 1989).

Two principal component analyses were conducted using the transformed data. The first principal component analysis (PCA1) was conducted for the variables plant density, tiller density and above-ground biomass measured at PI. The factorial axis of PCA1 reflected the canopy architecture measured in the fields at PI. The second analysis (PCA2) included panicle density, straw weight, spikelet density, filled spikelets percentage and single grain weight measured at maturity. Yield was introduced as a supplementary variable in the PCA2 to evaluate the weight of each factorial axis in explaining its variability. The factorial axis of PCA2 reflected the yield structure at maturity. We used software package ADE-4 (Thioulouse et al., 1996).

The effects of crop installation (direct seeding or transplanting) and management (weeding and N fertilizer) were measured on the factor loadings of PCA1 and PCA2 through ANOVA.

3. Results and discussion .

3.1. Effects of soil variability
Soil analyses showed that P Olsen ranged from 5.9 to 32 mg kg 1, with an average of 15.1
mg kg 1. Dobermann et al. (1995) reported critical levels for Olsen plant available P from 4 to 29 mg kg 1. The range of critical levels reported in literature for K availability in rice soils is between 0.1 and 0.4 cmol kg soil 1 (Dobermann et al., 1995). In our fields, exchangeable K values varied from 0.2 to 1.2 cmol kg 1. CEC ranged from 10 to 32 cmol kg 1 and were strongly correlated with clay content (r2 /0.857). CEC may affect availability of micro-nutrients, but no signs of deficiency were observed in any field. Soil texture has an influence on soil-water status, but all fields were well-watered and drought stress did not occur in harvested plots. The pH of the topsoil varied between 5.1 and 7.5. Electrical conductivity (EC) values ranged from 0.02 to 0.23 mS cm 1. These values do not constitute a constraint to irrigated rice cropping (Asch and Wopereis, 2000). We assumed, therefore, that initial soil P and K status and soil salinity levels were not hampering rice growth.
3.2. Effects of weather variability
Rice grain yields ranged from 0 to 9.5 Mg ha 1 (Table 1), with an average yield of 5 t ha 1 over both years and seasons. Yields may have been over-estimated somewhat due to the relatively small size of the micro-plots. The average yield gap between potential yields and farmers' yields was, therefore, about 4 /5 Mg ha 1. Three fields were not harvested in the 1995 dry season and one field in the 1994 dry season due to extensive bird

other seasons (Table 1). Yield components are

lower in the dry season as compared to the wet season (P B/0.0001). Differences in other yield
components were not significantly different.

RIDEV-simulated year-round variability of spikelet sterility and growth duration using Podor
weather data (Fig. 2) are shown in Fig. 3. If one
would accept an average spikelet sterility of 15% or less (this percentage can be greater than 30% in
a specific year), it would be best to sow I Kong Pao in Podor between 7 December and 3 September. If this percentage may not exceed 30% in any year (the maximum spikelet sterility must still be lower than 30%), the most favorable periods are from 22 December to 1 January, from 31 January to 22 February and from 22 March to 24 August. January sowing may lead to flowering in April, when temperatures are still relatively low, in some years leading to spikelet sterility due to cold. February and March sowing may lead to flowering in May to early June, when temperatures are very high, which may lead to spikelet sterility due to heat. For transplanting, these best sowing periods need to be moved forward by 10 /15 days.

At the scheme level, the first two sowing periods (from 22 December to 1 January and from 31 January to 22 February) are too short to sow all the fields. Therefore, the favorable sowing period is from the end of March to the end of August, i.e. about 5 months. The average growth duration in the dry season is about 4 months (Fig. 3), leaving only 1 month to prepare the field for the next crop on the same field. Double cropping requires good collective organization at the scheme scale (Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Farmers will often prefer to grow two crops on different fields or schemes.

RIDEV simulations using actual sowing dates of sample farmers showed that sowing dates were well chosen. Only 1 farmer may have experienced a 10% spikelet sterility problem in the 1995 wet season. The relatively low filled spikelet percentage values in Table 2 are, therefore, due to grain filling problems, and not spikelet sterility.

Yield losses due to late harvesting could not be analyzed in this study as all micro-plots were harvested at physiological maturity. Farmers harvested their fields shortly after physiological maturity in the dry seasons of 1994 and 1995. During the wet seasons of 1994 and 1995 they harvested their fields about 15 days after physiological maturity.

The canopy architecture measured at PI significantly differed (P B/0.0001) in the dry and wet seasons for both crop establishment methods (Table 3). Cold temperatures during crop establishment in the dry season induced lower levels of above-ground biomass and slower development

with higher level of tillering. Farmers compensated for these harsher conditions by using a higher density of sowing or transplanting in the dry season as compared to the wet season.

3.3. Effects of crop management other than choice
of sowing and harvest dates .

3.3.1. Crop establishment .

All farmers used pre-germinated seed, however, the large majority of farmers did not use certified seeds. In direct-seeded fields, between 80 and 200 kg ha 1 was applied, i.e. about 380 /950 grains m 2. Plant density measured at PI was 265 plants m 2, i.e. less than half of the density of seeds sown. Plant density was higher in the dry season than in the wet season. Farmers increased their sowing densities to compensate mortality induced by cold during emergence. Plant density was very variable, both within and between fields. Poor seed quality and poor land preparation and leveling explain the low ratio of plant density over seed density. The variability between fields is related to the use of different seeding rates, but differences in weed infestation levels were also important. The variability of densities was greater in the dry season than in the wet season. Cold temperatures at the onset of rice development increased the effects of variability in emergence conditions (seed quality, land preparation, weed infestation).

Farmers transplanted relatively old seedlings. Seedling age varied from 21 to 42 days (average 32 days) in the wet season and from 26 to 49 days (average 38 days) in the dry season. The number of hills per m2 was substantially greater in the dry season (36) as compared to the wet season (19). Like in direct-seeded fields, farmers compensated for cold at the onset of the dry season by transplanting a higher number of seedlings per hill, and a higher number of hills per m2. The number of seedlings per hill was relatively high, i.e. 3.8 in the wet season and 4.6 in the dry season. Farmers explained that they prefer older seedlings because they are taller and can support higher levels of water in the field. However, older seedlings suffer from prolonged transplanting
shock, reducing tillering capacity (Dingkuhn et al., 1990).

3.3.2. Weed management .

Calibration of visual weed estimates showed that a weed surface cover of less than 10% corresponded to between 0 and 24 g dry weed biomass m 2. A surface cover between 10 and 30% corresponded to a weed biomass between 13 and 228 g m 2, and a cover of more than 30% corresponded to a biomass greater than 130 g m 2. Weed infestation was more pronounced and intervened earlier in the growth cycle in directseeded fields, and weed pressure was higher at the end of the cycle than at PI. At PI, high levels of weed infestation (weed cover /10% of the area) was observed in 33 out the 50 direct-seeded plots and only 11 out the 37 transplanted plots. At maturity, low levels of weed infestation (weed cover B/10% of the area) concerned only 7 direct-seeded plots vs. 17 transplanted plots.

In direct-seeded fields weed control was mainly chemical. Only 1 field did not receive any herbicide. The large majority of farmers used postemergence herbicides. These herbicides require field drainage and should ideally be applied at the 2 /3 leaf stages of weeds. These conditions were, however, rarely followed, as was also observed by Le Gal et al. (1990), Diagne (1995), Diallo and Johnson (1997). The dosage applied was smaller than recommended in 18 out of the 22 fields treated with herbicides. Some farmers hand weeded at tillering stage, however none hand weeded prior to the second N application, which explains the increase in weed biomass towards maturity. In the transplanted fields, 14 out of the 17 fields were treated with pre- or post-emergence herbicides at rates below recommended levels. Only 2 farmers hand weeded before the second N split, and weed biomass increased towards maturity.

3.3.3. Nitrogen fertilizer management .

The average total amount of N applied was 141 kg ha 1 and 33 out of the 45 fields received more than 100 kg ha 1. The average total amount of P applied was 23 kg ha 1 and 34 fields received less than 20 kg ha 1.

J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356 349
In the 27 direct-seeded fields, 10 fields received only 1 split, 7 early in the growth cycle, and 3 late. The first split was applied at the recommended development stage (start of tillering) and at the recommended dosage ( /50 kg ha 1) in 15 fields. The second split was applied at the recommended stage (PI) in 18 fields, but the dosage was below the recommended level (B/50 kg ha 1) in 6 fields. Only 8 farmers followed all recommendations for N application. The majority of farmers that followed recommendations for the first split, also did so for the second N application.

The 18 transplanted fields received all two splits of N, and all farmers applied N to their rice seedling nurseries. The first split in the main field was applied at the recommended development stage (after transplanting shock) and at the recommended dosage in only six fields. The second split was applied at the recommended time in 16 fields, but only three farmers applied 50 kg N ha 1 or more.

Generally, farmers followed recommendations as far as N dosage and number of splits was concerned, but they did not follow recommended application dates. Similar observations were made elsewhere in West Africa (Becker and Johnson, 1999; Wopereis et al., 1999) and Asia (Singh et al., 1995; Cassman et al., 1997). Transplanted fields were generally better followed than direct-seeded fields. The second split was applied at the recommended stage and at the recommended dosage in the majority of cases. N fertilization of the seedling
nursery will have compensated for late application of the first N split, or application of a relatively low dosage. Weed infestation levels were lower in transplanted fields at the beginning of the growth cycle, and N application will, therefore, have been more effective in these fields.

3.3.4. Principal component analyses .

The first axis (S1) of the PCA1 explained 80% of the variability observed (Table 4), indicating a strong correlation between plant density, tiller density and above-ground biomass at PI. S1 measures plant stand and growth at PI. Table 5 shows the effect of weed infestation at PI combined with N management (first application) on the S1 factor loadings. In the direct-seeded plots, management of the first N application had a significant effect on the S1 factor loadings (P B/ 0.01). Negative factor loadings were found if recommendations on the first N application were not followed, and positive factor loadings if the recommendations were followed. For transplanted plots, management of the first N application did not have a significant effect on S1 factor loadings. For both direct-seeded and transplanted microplots, good weed management (weed cover B/ 10%) combined with a first N application following recommendations resulted in the highest average S1 factor loading. The S1 factor loadings for the transplanted micro-plots were significantly lower than those of direct-seeded micro-plots (P B/0.001). Positive S1 factor loadings were only

obtained in fields with a transplanting density of
/20 hills m 2 in the wet season and /40
hills m 2 in the dry season (Fig. 4).

The first two axes of the PCA2 explained 72% of total variance (Table 4). The first axis, explaining 47% of total variability, illustrates the strong correlation between panicle density, straw weight and spikelet density. This axis reflected plant density and yield potential at maturity. The second
axis explained about 25% of variability, representing essentially the variability in filled spikelet
percentage and single grain weight. Yield (transformed data, i.e. margins after removing the
effects of year, variety and season on the averages)
was very well represented on the first axis. Table 6 shows that in both direct-seeded and transplanted
micro-plots, management of the second N application and the level of weed infestation had a significant effect (P B/0.001) on factor loadings
of the first factorial axis of PCA2 (S2). S2 factor
loadings for direct-seeded micro-plots were on average not significantly higher than for transplanted micro-plots (Table 6).

Differences in yield components (margins after removing the effects of year, variety and season on
the averages) between direct-seeded and transplanted plots were quite substantial although yields were similar (Table 7). Transplanted plots
had higher spikelet density than direct-seeded
plots, compensated with slightly lower single grain weight; they had also lower panicle density compensated with higher number of spikelets per
panicle than direct-seeded plots. This lower panicle

density is illustrated by the lower S1 factor loadings at PI. Low S1 factor loadings lead to low S2 factor loadings apart from the wellmanaged plots (weed infestation at maturity B/ 10% area and second N application following recommendation) as shown in Fig. 5.

Well-managed plots in terms of fertilizer and weed management resulted in substantially higher grain yields (increase on average of 2.8 t ha 1, see Table 7). This yield increase in both direct and
transplanted plots was entirely due to an increase in spikelet density linked with an increase in panicle density and/or number of spikelet per panicle. Our results agree well with observations by Haefele et al. (2000) who reported an increase of 2 t ha 1 through improved soil fertility and weed management.

4. Conclusions .

Soil and weather variability had a relatively minor effect on rice yield variability in farmers' fields. Simulation analysis showed that farmers used sowing dates within the window recommended for wet and dry seasons, avoiding spikelet sterility due to cold or heat stress around flowering. Harvest dates were also close to physiological maturity of the rice crop. Yield variability was, therefore, mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season reduced crop growth and increased within-field tiller density variability. Direct seeding resulted in relatively high but strongly variable plant density and more vigorous growth in the vegetative phase than with transplanting. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities at PI, as illustrated by the low S1

factor Loadings in PCA1. Management of the first N split and weed infestation levels had a relatively minor effect on plant stand at PI in transplanted plots, but a very important effect in direct-seeded plots. Management of the second N application and weed infestation levels affected panicle density and the number of spikelets per panicle in both direct-seeded and transplanted plots, but had no effect on single rice grain weight and filled spikelets percentage. Wopereis-Pura et al. (2002) reported benefits from a third N splits in terms of yield and grain quality. None of the farmers in this study applied N in three splits.

Results indicate the importance of good crop management in general in irrigated systems in the Sahel. Yields that are realized in farmers' fields are still far from the potential that can be obtained with the rice cultivars that are being used. Kebbeh et al. (2002) demonstrated that information on improved and integrated crop management (ICM) is crucial to help farmers bridge this yield gap. Increasing fertilizer and herbicide use efficiencies will also reduce losses of N and herbicides to the environment.

Improved and ICM would increase the efficiency of inputs, such as N fertilizer and herbicide and seed quantity used. WARDA and partners have developed improved ICM options for irrigated rice cropping in the Sahel that are within farmers' means, based on farm surveys, and farmer participatory on- and off-station research (Wopereis et al., 2002). For the Senegal River Valley, these options have been summarized in a manual and posters (WARDA and SAED, 2001). These posters are based on RIDEV simulations and are specific to location, crop establishment technique, sowing date and cultivar choice, and can be adapted easily. The posters give a farming calendar with management options for a given site /sowing date /cultivar choice /crop establishment technique combination, and relevant information is given to enable farmers to adapt them according to their means.

However, ICM at the field level is also strongly dependent on the collective organization at the scheme level (Poussin, 1995, 1998; Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Sowing date, crop implantation method, herbicide and fertilizer quantities are not
decided individually and irrigation depends on water allocation rules. IRD and partners have, therefore, developed software that integrates the RIDEV simulation model at the scheme level (Poussin, 2000).

Effect of late nitrogen application on rice yield, grain quality and profitability in the Senegal River valley .

The effect of an additional nitrogen (N) application of 30 kg N ha at booting on rice yield and grain quality was investigated with 30 farmers in the Senegal River valley during the 1997 wet season (WS) and 23 farmers during the 1998 dry season (DS). Rice yields increased significantly as a result of an extra late N application on top of two N-dressings with a total of about 120 kg N ha in farmer fields. Yield gains were about 1.0 t ha during the 1998 DS and about 0.4 t ha during the 1997 WS. Grain quality was improved through a higher milling recovery (3% increase in both seasons) and a higher percentage of head rice (30% higher in the 1997 WS and 60% higher in the 1998 DS). Benefit to cost ratios of the third nitrogen application for farmers ranged from 2.8 in the WS to 5.4 in the DS. Sorting milled rice resulted in net additional benefits for rice millers, especially in the DS, due to a higher head rice ratio. It was concluded that a third N application can raise both yield levels and grain quality in the Senegal River valley, with potential benefits for farmers and rice millers.

1. Introduction .

About 100,000 ha of irrigation schemes have been developed along the Senegal River in Mauritania and Senegal. During the 1998 wet season (WS) (July to December) about 20,000 ha were in use in Senegal and 17,000 ha in Mauritania.

Potential yield (limited by radiation and temperature only) is about 9 t ha-1 for WS sowing in
July and about 9-10 t ha-1 for dry season (DS) sowing in February in the Senegal River delta (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997). Wopereis et al. (1999) showed that yield gaps between potential and actual farmers' yields in the 1997 WS ranged from 1 to 8 t ha-1 in the Senegal River valley. Major biophysical constraints included phosphorus (P) deficient soils, weed competition, relatively low nitrogen (N) application rates and sub-optimal timing of N application. Despite these constraints, fertilizer N use proved highly profitable in irrigated systems in the Sahel (Donovan et al., 1999). * Corresponding author. E-mail Address: P.wopereis@cgiar.org (M.M.

Wopereis et al. (1999) proposed to improve rice productivity and profitability by increasing N recovery (through improved crop management practices) or increasing the amount of N applied. Hafele et al. (2000, 2001) demonstrated the profitability of improved soil fertility and weed management for small and large scale rice farmers in Senegal and Mauritania. Another possibility to raise profitability would be to improve the quality of rice produced. Price differences in Senegal between low and high quality rice are huge. Whole grain American rice is sold in the Senegalese capital Dakar for 380 CFA1 kg-1, whole grain rice imported from India of lower quality (dark color, relative high percentage of impurities) sells for 190 CFA kg-1. Imported broken rice from Vietnam, Thailand, India, Pakistan and Argentina sells for 160-175 CFA kg-1. An estimated 350,000-450,000 t of rice is consumed annually in Senegal, of which 15,000 tons is whole grain rice. The Mauritanian and Senegalese governments consider raising the quality of domestically produced rice as a prerequisite to improve its competitiveness vis a vis imports. In Senegal, the national irrigation and extension authority for the Senegal River valley (SAED) has launched a rice quality program since 1998. Its objective is to increase production and value of locally produced rice.

Most farmers in the Senegal River valley apply N fertilizer only twice, i.e. roughly at the start of tillering and panicle initiation (PI). The quantities applied are often below recommended levels (Wopereis et al., 1999). The Japanese Food Agency (1998) recommended to apply N fertilizer around booting to enhance photosynthesis rate during the grain filling period, leading to a decrease in the percentage of immature grains and an increase in the percentage of whole grains. The objectives of this study were to: (i) explore the effect of a third N application around booting on rice yield and grain quality; and (ii) to determine potential financial benefits of a third N application for farmers and rice millers in the Senegal River valley.

2. Materials and methods .

2.1. Experimental sites and sampling methodologies
Debi and Tiguet (16degrees29 N, 16degrees17 W) are two arid coastal villages in the Senegal River delta. Topography is flat. The soil type is a salic Fluvisol according to FAO soil classification (FAO, 1990), local name Hollalde. Texture is heavy clay. The climate is characterized by a WS (about 200 mm rainfall) from July to September, a cold dry season from October to February and a hot dry season from March to June.

Debi-Tiguet is a modern irrigation scheme of about 1000 ha, cultivated by 400 farmers. Irrigation and drainage structures were constructed in 1996 through Japanese government funding. The irrigation scheme is divided into two areas, i.e. Debi (farmers from the Debi village) and Tiguet (farmers from Tiguet village). These two areas are further subdivided into sections. A trained village technician supervises each section. An extension agent of SAED (Societe National d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des Terres du Delta du Fleuve Senegal et des Vallees du Fleuve Senegal et de la Faleme) advises each village technician on various crop management interventions using RIDEV. RIDEV is a decision support tool developed by WARDA (Dingkuhn, 1997). It advises extension agents and farmers on optimal timing of crop management interventions, i.e. timing of sowing, weeding, fertilizer application, drainage before harvest and harvest.

Rice cultivation and management are autosufficient in terms of seed supply, irrigation and rice grain milling. The mill is managed by the farmers' union of the Debi and Tiguet villages (Moreira, 1999).

We selected 30 farmers in the 1997 WS and 23 in the 1998 DS that participated in previous SAED surveys and followed RIDEV recommendations. Each farmer's field was relatively free of weeds, and had good irrigation and drainage facilities. Farmers applied N fertilizer twice, i.e. at the start of tillering and at PI, following RIDEV timing. Each farmer's plot was divided into two except for some special cases where plots were too 1 The Franc CFA (CFA) is the currency used in Senegal and is pegged to the French Franc and the Euro. The exchange rates to convert CFA are: 100 CFA=1 French franc; 1 euro=6.55957 French francs.
large for the experiment. In such cases, a portion of the farmer's field was divided and marked into two plots. One part, selected at random, was left as farmers' practice (T0). A third nitrogen application was applied at booting stage at a rate of 30 kg ha-1 (T1) on the other part of the field. Farmers used two rice cultivars (IR1529 and Jaya) during the 1997 WS, and exclusively IR13240-108-2-2-3 (released as Sahel 108 in Senegal in 1994) during the 1998 DS. All rice was direct-seeded.

Harvesting was done at physiological maturity from a 6 m2 sampling area at three sites within each plot. Grain yield was adjusted to 14% moisture content. Yield components were estimated from a sampling area of 0.30 m2 repeated three times within each plot. Threshing was completed 2 weeks after harvest. Grain moisture content was taken at harvest and twice weekly during storage by Kett riceter moisture meter. Temperature and relative humidity of the storage room were recorded periodically. Grain samples from the 1997 WS were analyzed in June 1998 and grain samples from the 1998 DS were analyzed by the end of October 1998 in WARDA's grain quality laboratory in Ndiaye, Senegal. WS samples were stored for 7 months. DS samples were stored for only 4 months.
2.2. Grain quality analysis
Each grain sample was processed as follows. Grain moisture content was measured before husking using a Kett PM 600 moisture meter for 1997 WS samples, and a Kett PM 700 m for the 1998 DS samples. Test weight of paddy (a measure of the fullness of grains) for the 1997 WS were taken directly from measurements made with the Kett PM 600 moisture meter. Test weight for 1998 DS samples were derived from the weight of 240 ml paddy in grams divided by 240 ml and multiplied by 1000. Three measurements were made for each sample.

Husking recovery was measured by husking 300 gram of paddy and dividing resulting brown rice weight in grams by 300 and multiplying by 100%. Brown rice thickness was determined by passing
100 g of brown rice through 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9 mm sieves. Brown rice was calculated as the sum of brown rice weight in grams multiplied by the corresponding sieve width used, divided by 100 g. Composition of brown rice was determined from a 20 g brown rice sample. Complete, dead (including damaged and discolored grains), green and broken (less than 2/3 length of complete grains) grains were separated manually. The percentage of cracked brown rice was measured by counting the number of cracked grains through a Kett mirror reflector tray. For the grain hardness test, 50 brown rice grains were tested using a grain rigidity (hardness) tester Kiya type no. 140.

Milling recovery was measured by milling 150 g brown rice using a Yamamoto vertical type laboratory rice mill (VP 31T) and calculating the weight of milled rice in grams divided by 150 gram, and multiplying by 100%. Twenty gram milled rice was separated manually in head rice (including grains with more than 2/3 length of whole grains), large (grains between head rice and small broken) and small broken (grains that passed through a mesh of 2x2 mm2), and damaged (by insects or disease) grains. Rice grain whiteness was measured using a whiteness tester Kett C-300.

Grain nitrogen content was measured by standard macro-Kjeldahl procedure. Grain protein content was calculated by multiplying grain nitrogen content by 5.95, the nitrogen-protein conversion factor (Yasui and Tsutsumi, 1982).

Statistical analysis was done using Statistica and SPSS. Analysis was done by season and by variety.
2.3. Calculating benefits from late N application
The additional costs of applying a third split of 30 kg N ha-1 were based on: (a) urea price of 9000 CFA per bag of 50 kg; (b) transport costs of 200 CFA per bag of 50 kg; (c) additional labor costs for the third fertilizer application of 1000 CFA ha-1; (d) an interest rate of 12% for the 1997 WS and 7.5% for the 1998 DS; and (e) additional harvest costs due to increased yield, i.e. calculated as 10% of additional yield and costs of
extra bags. Additional benefits for farmers were calculated as the yield difference between T1 and T0 multiplied by a paddy price of 100 CFA kg-1. Net benefits were determined as additional benefits minus total additional costs. Benefit cost ratios of late N application was determined as additional benefits divided by additional costs.

Potential financial returns of high quality paddy as a result of late N application for rice millers were determined as well. Price ranges for different rice qualities were taken from SIMRIZ (Senegal government rice market management and survey unit) weekly market surveys. For this study, prices were taken from the survey conducted during the first week of August 1998 in St. Louis (closest large rice market from Debi-Tiguet, at a distance of about 80 km). Non-aromatic broken rice prices fluctuated between 180 and 225 CFA kg-1. Non-aromatic head rice minimum prices were between 360 and 380 CFA kg-1.

We used the minimum price of non-aromatic broken and head rice to calculate benefits for rice millers assuming they sell 1 t of milled rice from a farmers' field (T0) and 1 t of milled rice from a field where a third split of 30 kg N ha-1 was applied at booting (T1) for both sorted (in head rice and brokens) and nonsorted rice. Sorting was assumed to be performed manually at a cost of 3000 CFA t-1.

Farmers' sowing dates ranged from 14 to 31 July for the WS and from 3 to 11 March in the DS. Total N applied in the T0 plots during the WS was 116 kg N ha-1 and for the DS 127 kg N ha-1. Farmers applied the first N split (a mixture of di-ammonium phosphate and urea) on average at 27 days after sowing (DAS), and the second split (urea only) at 61 DAS during the WS, and at 30 and 63 DAS during the DS. The third nitrogen application of 30 kg N ha-1 as urea in the T1 plots was applied on average at 75 DAS during the 1997 WS and at 79 DAS during the DS. Harvesting time ranged from 110 to 124 DAS during the WS (average: at 117 DAS) and from 118 to 132 DAS (average 125 DAS) for the DS.

3. Results and discussions .

3.1. Farmers' crop management practices
Average WS T0 yield was high, i.e. 7.3 ha-1 (ranging from 5.0 to 9.4 t ha-1), considering the region's potential yield of about 9 t ha-1. Yield gain due to the third N application was relatively small, i.e. about 0.4 t ha-1, but statistically significant. There were some varietal differences with slightly higher yields for IR1529 as compared to Jaya. Average DS T0 yield was relatively low, i.e. 4.4 t ha-1 (ranging from 2.5 to 6.0 t ha-1), due to poor water control and weed infestation. The yield gain due to the third N application was important, i.e. almost 1 t ha-1 and statistically significant. Yield component analyses showed that there were clear problems with spikelet sterility during the DS (average of 24% as compared to 11% in the WS), partly explaining low DS yields.

The third N application increased husking recovery by 1% in the WS but did not affect husking recovery in the DS. The percentage of green grains in T1 was significantly higher for IR 1529 in the DS and Sahel 108 in the WS (Table 1).

WS samples accumulated some moisture during the first week after harvest. Moisture content (MC) increased by about 1%, from 17 to 18% MC and declined sharply afterwards to 13% MC at 35 days after harvest (DAH). From 35 DAH onwards, grain moisture content decreased in an erratic way to about 12% MC, caused by rapid changes in temperature and relative humidity in the storage area. Storage conditions during the 1998 DS were more homogeneous and grain moisture content declined more gradually, i.e. from 19 to 14% MC in 110 days.

Although test weight and grain thickness did not increase significantly in T1, husking recovery increased in both varieties in WS (Table 1). This was likely brought by later maturity caused by late N application. Cracked grain content decreased remarkably in T1 except in Sahel 108. Cracked grain content was 10 times higher during the WS as compared to the DS (Table 1). This may be due to longer storage time of the WS samples (7 months as opposed to 4 months for the DS samples) and the abrupt changes in relative

humidity and temperature during storage. Rice grain quality was significantly improved by the third N application (Table 2). Milling recovery increased by 3% in both seasons. Head rice ratio increased by 12% in the WS and by 24% in the DS. The effect was especially high with IR1529 and Sahel 108. The percentage of large and small broken rice decreased accordingly.

Head rice ratio is affected by various pre- and post-harvest factors. The correlations of head rice ratio with major variables in milling characteristics is summarized in Table 3. Although correlation coefficients are relatively low, some observations can still be made. Milling recovery had the highest value, followed by green grain ratio and complete grain. Higher correlation is seen with percent cracked grain. Green grain ratio is an indicator of rice plant's juvenility, showing that late N application can delay the rice plant's senescence. This improves grain yield and grain quality through lower grain crack ratio and higher head ratio.

Fig. 1 shows that WS head rice ratios declined the more brown rice samples were cracked. WS head rice was significantly different (P=0.004) between treatments (T0=40 and T1=52% head rice). No effect was seen for DS samples as brown rice grains were hardly cracked during this season. Milled rice whiteness was about 2-5% higher for T0 samples as compared to T1 samples across cultivars and seasons because grains broke more easily. Nitrogen content in the grain was higher for the T1 treatment as compared to the T0 treatment (Fig. 2).
3.2. Financial benefits for farmers
Benefit: cost ratios of the third nitrogen application for farmers were relatively high for both seasons. The 1997 WS benefit: cost ratio was 2.8 and the 1998 DS benefit: cost ratio was 5.4 (Table 4). Additional harvest cost were slightly higher in the 1998 DS as compared to the 1997 WS due to the larger yield gain from the third N application. Total additional cost of the third nitrogen appli-
the importance of proper storage. Wet season samples were not stored properly, affecting the percentage of head rice. The percentage of N in the grains was improved through late N application. Farmers and millers in the Senegal River delta can profit from these results to produce high quality rice. To arrive at a quality product, a sequence of activities from sowing to milling should be done correctly. Rice seed quality, weeding, fertilizer applications, timely harvest, proper storage and good mill maintenance will all affect grain quality. Improved interaction between rice miller and rice farmer is crucial to improve grain quality and profitability of irrigated rice production in the Senegal River delta.

4. Conclusions .

A late additional nitrogen application of 30 kg N ha-1 increased yield by about 0.4 t ha-1 during the wet season and by about 1.0 t ha-1 during the dry season. It also improved grain quality (higher head rice ratio) and milling recovery. Farmers can get an additional net benefit of between 30,000 and 80,000 CFA ha-1. Millers can also benefit from a late N application. Head rice ratios increased by 12-24%. Results showed

Adapting rainfed rice to climate change: a case study in Senegal .

Rainfed crop production predominates in West Africa. Rice is an important staple food, especially in Senegal. The scope for increase in rice production under irrigated conditions is uncertain. Rainfed rice is therefore a key component for regional food security impelling agronomists to assess climate change impact on rainfed rice yield and to design rainfed rice ideotypes suited to future climate scenarios. The DSSATCSM-CERES-Rice model was thus calibrated and evaluated on 19 agronomic experiments conducted in 2012, 2013, and 2014, in 6 locations, with 21 cultivars and two fertilization levels (20 and 80 kg N ha). Simulations were then carried out with the crop model forced with the downscaled projections of seven climate models, with and without considering the impact of an increase in atmospheric [CO2], using an ensemble of global circulation models and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Simulated rice yield was divided by two over the century with RCP8.5 and stagnated with RCP2.6. Elevated [CO2] significantly increased yields, but this effect could not offset the yield decline due to elevated temperatures. Cultivars with longer vegetative phases and greater temperature tolerance were better adapted to climate change than current cultivars. Using these new cultivars with the recommended fertilization rate (80 kgN ha) could offset the yield decline due to climate change. For the first time, we bring together a study based on a process-based crop model handling crop response to elevated [CO2], a large set of field experiments and up-to-date climate projections (i) to provide useful insights into plausible impacts of climate change on rainfed rice in Senegal and (ii) to identify cultivar characteristics relevant for adaptation to future possible climates. Our findings will help set priorities for breeding resilient cultivar in the region.

1 introduction .

Rice is the world's most important food crop, estimated as the staple food for half of humanity. The demand for rice is expected to increase with population growth. West African countries like Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea are highly dependent on rice for food calories. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute (Glatzel 2018), the average Senegalese consumes about 85 kg of rice each year. The government has embarked on political efforts to achieve self-sufficiency for rice, with public investments, price protection, and extension services reinforcement. The national long-term economic development strategy targets rice self-sufficiency for the country by 2035. The efforts focus on both irrigated and rainfed rice. After a marked decline during the dry decades at the end of the previous century, rainfed rice cultivation has expanded rapidly in Senegal, especially in Kaffrine, Senegal oriental, and Casamance regions. In the above-mentioned regions, the rainy season covers only 5 months, from June to October.

commitment to improve rice production, inadequate water, soil, and crop management still compromises paddy yield productivity. Rice production is also threatened by variability in annual rainfall, fluctuations in the onset of growing season, and increase in aridity (Koudahe et al. 2017). Assessments of the changes in local climatic variables and their impact on rice yield are currently scarce.

Water availability for crops in Africa varies strongly over space and time. It is a major constraint for the continent's economic development, which may become even stronger with climate warming. In most regions of sub-Saharan Africa, climate change will likely increase water stress with detrimental effects on crop yield (Roudier et al. 2011). Ensuring sustainable agriculture in semi-arid to sub-humid Africa requires adaptation to climatic variability and change.

Climate change, as simulated by Global Climate Models (GCM), includes a gradual increase in temperature, modification of rainfall patterns and amounts, and increase in the frequency of extreme events (Barry et al. 2018). The impacts of these perturbations on rice cropping systems in Asia have been extensively investigated (Li et al. 2015; Kontgis et al. 2019). Impact studies on rainfed rice in Sudanian regions of Africa are much scarcer, despite the fact that rice is one of the major staple food. Global assessments, including the whole Africa, have been performed, but they are not based on model calibration with accurate field data (Oort and Zwart 2017). In West Africa, an increase in the frequency and the magnitude of extreme events (heavy rains, heat waves) is expected as well as a decline and a slight increase in annual rainfall in the west and east of the region, respectively (Diedhiou et al. 2018). Rainfed crop production dominates in West Africa, making the region a climate change hotspot. To our knowledge, among the very few studies focusing on the impact of climate change on rice yield inWest Africa (Zhang et al. 2019; Traore et al. 2020), none used a process-based crop model, calibrated and evaluated for a set of cultivars based on field measurements. These studies based on statistical modelling overlooked the impact of elevated [CO2] on crop growth.

Breeding cultivars with adequate characteristics can offset yield losses by limiting rice sterility with high temperatures (Jagadish et al. 2015). Adequate characteristics identified with field and glasshouse experiments include increased transpiration cooling, early morning flowering, shifts in phenology to avoid stresses, and increased spikelet numbers and sink strength (Sheehy et al. 2001). Experiments on specific physiological capacities and omics investigations of a large number of traits and their interactions require resources and take time. Plant traits expression and its impact on yield also vary with agronomic practices. Increasing the amount of applied mineral fertilizer can improve crop yield. However, rainfed cropping systems prevail in Senegal and drought can severely undermine the benefits related to mineral fertilizer application. Unfavorable value/cost ratio currently prevent adoption of
increased rates of mineral fertilizer application (Jayne et al. 2018). Crop simulation models can integrate the knowledge on physiological processes to help explain yield limitations in varying environments and agrosystems. CSM-CERES-Rice has been used in India and China for investigating climate change impacts on rice production (Yao et al. 2007). With calibrated cultivar parameters used as proxy for physiological traits, the model can help investigate genotype*environment interactions and design rice ideotypes for adaptation to climate change as it was done for other crops and models (Rotter et al. 2015).

In this study, we examined the potential impact of climate change on rainfed rice yield in Senegal. We based our assessment on the calibration of a crop model on a large field trials dataset with 21 different cultivars and multiple environments. Simulations were carried-out with a crop model that took as daily input the downscaled projections of seven climate models to take into account the uncertainties in climate projections. We also simulated possible adaptations strategies using ideotypes with adaptive traits.

2 Material and methods .

In order to provide useful predictions, a model has to be calibrated locally. To search for ideotypes, this has to be done on a set of contrasted cultivars, of which we expect that the parameters genotypic variability will reflect the cultivated diversity.

2.1 environments .

Nineteen field trials were carried out from 2012 to 2014 in the Sudanian and Sudano-Sahelian zones of Senegal to test the adaptation of rice cropping systems to drought conditions. Six sites (see fig. 1 In supplementary materials) were considered: Darou (13degrees 57'36'' N/15degrees 50'24'' W), Sinthiou Maleme (13degrees 49'48'' N/13degrees 54'36'' W), Ndama (13degrees 49'12'' N/15degrees 4 2'01'' W), Dieri (13degrees 37'12'' N/15degrees 34'12'' W), Kolda (12degrees 51'36'' N/14degrees 57'00'' W), and Sefa (12degrees49'48'' N/15degrees 35'24'' W). Current average rainfall from June to October is 500-600 mm, 600-700 mm, 600-700 mm, 700-800 mm, 900-1000 mm, and 1000-1100 mm in the different sites, respectively. The experimental sites were chosen to cover the range of pedoclimatic conditions found in South and East Senegal (Fig. 1), where rainfed rice is one of the main crops. Dieri and Ndama hosted farmers field experiments, while the other sites hosted on-station controlled experiments.

The experimental design at all sites was fully randomized blocks with three to four replicated plots, two fertilization rates, and 4 to 21 cultivars tested in each experiment. Plot size was 2.5 mwide x 3m long = 7.5 m2, with 10 rows and 15 hills
per row. The dataset was divided into a calibration and a validation dataset (Table 1). Each cultivar was grown under two fertilization rates, namely F1=80 kg N ha-1 and F2=20 kg N ha-1, either in controlled conditions or on farmers' fields. Observation on on-station plots (averaged across replicates) with F1=80 kg N ha-1 (assumed to be stress-free conditions) were used for model calibration. On-station plots with F2=20 kg N ha-1 and plots in farmers' field experiments were used for model validation (Table 1).

2.2 weather data .

Daily rainfall data was collected on experimental sites with rain gauges. Daily temperatures were collected on sites with automatic sensors Tinytag Plus 2 (Tinytag) placed under shelter (in Sefa, Darou, Kolda) or at the closest official meteorological station (Nioro station 13degrees45'00''N/15degrees48'00'' W) for Dieri Kao and Ndama sites. Relative humidity and global radiation were collected at the closest station of the public network of meteorological stations, at Kolda (12degrees 53'00'' N/14degrees 57'00'' W) for Kolda and Sefa and at Nioro for Dieri Kao, Ndama, and Darou. All Sinthiou data were collected on site through an automatic agrometeorological station CIMEL ENERCO 405 ((c) Cimel Electronique S.A.S France). The data was collected from 2012 to 2014.

2.3 cultivars .

The 21 cultivars used in the experiment were either hybrids, japonica, or indica type and came from various breeding centers (Table 2).

2.4 Soil sampling and analysis .

Agricultural soils in Senegal are well known, and many of their chemical and physical properties in deeper layers can be relatively well derived from key properties of the top layers using reference soil profiles. Soil analyses were conducted on four soil samples per experiment, done at 3 depths (0-10, 10- 20, and 20-30 cm) and averaged. Soil depth in the region is also known to be either over 5m, i.e., much greater than rooting depth of most annual crops, or very shallow when soils are on lateritic deposits. In each experimental location, auger prospection down to 1 m deep was carried out to ensure that soils belong to the former case. Physical and chemical properties were analyzed at ISRA laboratory at Bambey. All soils were sandy, i.e., none of them hadmore than 20% clay + silt (Table 1). Carbon, organic matter, and organic nitrogen contents were low, and pH in water ranged from 5.3 to 7.2.

2.5 plant observations .

Rice anthesis and maturity were observed on the main stem of six plants per plots. Anthesis and maturity dates corresponded to the date when three plants out of the six had reached the stage. Biomass at anthesis was measured on 10 hills randomly taken on two side lines.

Grain weight, plant biomass, number of spikelets, tillers, and grains were measured at harvest on a central subplot (6 lines x 7 hills). All plants samples were dried at 65 degrees during 72 h before weighing.

2.6 Simulation of rice growth .

The DSSAT 4.7.1.0 cropping system model (DSSAT-CSM) (Boote et al. 2003) was used. DSSAT-CSM simulates soil nitrogen, water, and carbon dynamics. CSM-CERES-Rice

41 4 model is a process-based model that is embedded within DSSAT. It has been used to simulate rice growth and yield for decades (Buddhaboon et al. 2018). The climate driving variables have a daily time step: maximum and minimum air temperatures, solar radiation and precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed when available. In DSSAT, potential evapotranspiration can be computed either using the Penman-Monteith equation following the method of Allen et al. (Allen et al. 1998) or using the Priestley and Taylor approach (Priestley and Taylor 1972). We used the more accurate Penman-Monteith approach in all the simulations using observed weather data, but used the Priestley-Taylor approach for simulations under future climate since CMIP5 models do not provide estimates of wind speed and relative humidity that are required for the Penman-Monteith approach. We used the global solar radiation as input data and applied a 0.5 ratio to get the photosynthetically active radiation. In DSSAT the soil is represented assuming horizontal homogeneity and considering a number of superposed horizontal soil layers. The soil properties of the 20-30 cm layer were applied to the below 30-100 cm horizon with a 50% reduced C and N content. Soil water dynamics is simulated based on the classic reservoir analogy. Soil water retention parameters (soil moisture at wilting point and field capacity) are derived from soil texture (Gijsman et al. 2002). The crop model calculates a daily water stress factors as the ratio of soil water availability in the rooting zone over crop potential transpiration. Water stress
reduces the rate of leaf growth, radiation conversion, and grain filling; accelerates senescence; and determines the ratio of actual over potential transpiration. Plant growth, development, and yield depend on species- and cultivar-dependent parameters determining the sensitivity of crops to variations in their environment. The rice team (i.e., a partnership between the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), University of Florida, and the global Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP)) has studied rice models under varying climatic conditions (Hasegawa et al. 2017) and proposed a new set of cultivardependent parameters, the so-called genetic coefficients, to ensure that CERES-Rice correctly simulated the effect of high temperatures, drought, and increases in atmospheric [CO2]. These coefficients control crop development, such as flowering and maturing. There are eleven genetic coefficients defined in the CERES-Rice model. P1 (basic vegetative phase), P20 (critical photoperiod), and P2R (extent to which panicle initiation is delayed for each hour increase above P20) drive flowering onset. P5 is the length from flowering to grain maturity. G1 (potential spikelet number), G2 (single grain weight), G3 (relative tillering coefficient), and PHINT (phyllochron interval) influence crop growth and yield components. THOT, TCLDP, and TCLDS are the new temperature coefficients used to improve crop response to extreme temperatures. THOT drives spikelet sterility susceptibility to high temperatures; TCLDP and TCLDS modify respectively
panicle initiation and spikelet sterility when rice is exposed to low temperatures.

2.7 Model calibration and evaluation .

The DSSAT model was calibrated and evaluated for the varieties evaluated in the trials (see Section 2.3). Calibration was done by combining a trial and error procedure with GENCALC calculator runs. GENCALC uses a deterministic stepwise procedure to optimize plant parameters within realistic physiological ranges (Buddhaboon et al. 2018). In a first step, we calibrated parameters related to crop phenology against observed flowering and maturity dates. P1, P20, and P2R were first adjusted so that simulated flowering date matched with the observed date. P5 was then adjusted to improve model agreement with observed maturity. In a second step, the tillering coefficient G3 was calibrated against observed aboveground biomass at flowering and harvest. Adjustment of G3 can alter plant phenology simulation; therefore, flowering-related parameters were re-adjusted. In the last step, G1, G2, and THOT were calibrated against observed yield and yield components. TCLDP and TCLDS remained unchanged in our calibration process.

The parameters were adjusted until there was a close match between observed and simulated values. Root mean square error (RMSE), EF, and d-stat index were used to evaluate model performance following the recommendations by Willmott (1982) for model evaluation, due to limitations in the use of the modeling efficiency (EF) as an agreement index.

where xi is the i th observed value, yi the i th simulated value, n the number of observations, x. the mean of the observed variable, and y. the mean of simulated variable.

These indicators for the calibration dataset are shown in Table 3. Flowering and maturity dates were fairly well simulated, i.e. observed and simulated mean values were similar, and RMSE was 3.2 and 3.9 days for flowering and maturity dates, respectively. Intermediate variables like aboveground biomass at anthesis and harvest, byproducts (straw), and harvest index were not very well simulated. Average simulated and observed values were similar, but RMSE was large. The number of grains was simulated with a RMSE of 1587,
corresponding to 35% of the mean observed value. Measurement of aboveground biomass at anthesis and harvest required subplot sampling and transport. Drying usually occurred in suboptimal conditions, so that the estimates of aboveground biomass (dry matter) may not be as reliable as those for phenology, yield, and yield components that were obtained based on whole-plot sampling. Good correlation between observed and simulated grain yield were obtained in calibration (EF= 0.64, Supplementary materials: Fig 2a; d-stat = 0.9 and RMSE = 531) and validation (EF=0.47, Supplementary materials: Fig 2b; d-stat = 0.81 and RMSE = 405). Figure 2 shows the comparisons between simulated and observed values averaged for each cultivar, across years, fertilizer applications, and sites. Cultivar diversity with regard to number of panicles was not well reproduced by the model (EF = -1.26). Cultivar diversity with regard to number of grains, flowering date, and yield was adequately reproduced by the model with regression coefficients of 0.79, 0.90, and 0.77, respectively. We considered that the calibrated DSSATmodel represented each cultivar with a good accuracy, especially for phenology, grain yield, and its components. Values of the genetic parameters used in CSM-CERES-Rice can be found in supplementary materials (Table S1).

2.8 Statistical analysis of the experiments .

2.8.1 Tests on cultivars, years, and location effect and adjusted means .

The set of tested cultivars varied across experiments (Table 1). For a fair comparison of cultivars, we adjusted their mean performance to account for year and location effects like in an incomplete block design. Conversely, we adjusted year and location effects to account for cultivar effect. We carried out F-tests of cultivar, year, and location effects using Kenward and Roger's method for the denominator degrees of freedom (Kenward and Roger 1997). The dataset used included all onstation controlled experiments conducted at the four sites during 3 years, with the two fertilizer rates and the 21 cultivars.

2.8.2 Detection of main varietal and environmental drivers of rice grain yield .

In order to identify the key interactions between genotype traits and environments that were involved in yield variations, we conducted a covariance analysis on the dataset of onstation controlled experiment. The operational objective was to determine (i) the key features to be captured by the crop model and (ii) the key traits to account for when designing new ideotypes. We used the DSSAT genetic coefficients obtained from the calibration process as varietal covariates and soil and rainfall measurements in each trial as environmental covariates.

The varietal Covariates were P1, P2R, P5, P2O, G1, G2, G3, and Thot (supplementary materials, table S1). The environmental covariates were sowing date, cumulated rainfall from sowing to 60 days after sowing (rain_0_60) and from 60 to 90 days after sowing (rain_60_90), soil nitrogen (N), carbon (C), and clay+silt content (Table 1).

In order to comply with the error structure of the multi-site design, we considered experiment, genotype, environment, and interactions as random effects for this analysis. The resulting full linear mixed model was:
Zijkl (1/4) mth Sigmap xpi bp th Sigmaq yqj cq th Ai th Bj th ABd Thij th ck
th Acd Thik th Bcd Thjk th ABcd Thijk th Djl th Eijkl
where
Zijkl is the observed yield for variety i with fertilization k in replicate l of environment j. x1i, x2i... xPi are the values of the P varietal covariates for variety i y1j,y2j,... yQj are the values of the Q environmental covariates for environment j b1...bP are the regression coefficients on varietal covariates c1...cQ are the regression coefficients on environmental covariates Ai is the random effect of variety i, remaining after the effects of its covariates Bj is the random effect of environment j, remaining after the effects of its covariates (AB)ij is the random variety xx environment interaction ck is the fixed effect of fertilization level k (Ac)ik is the random variety xx fertilization interaction (Bc)jk is the random environment xx fertilization interaction (ABc)ijk is the random variety xx environment xx fertilization interaction Djl is the random effect of replicate l in environment j Eijkl is the residual error
Due to its considerable range, grain yield had a residual variance increasing with its mean, thus suggesting a transformation in order to stabilize it: (grain yield)0.3 was analyzed rather than the original yield. Displayed means were back-transformed (Table 4).

In order to select which covariates should enter the model, we compared all models with or without each covariate with the Schwartz Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Best models have the smallest BICs, and we considered that models not differing by more than two BICs were equivalent. Among models for which BIC did not exceed the smallest BIC by more than two,
we retained the model with the smallest number of covariates. Then, we checked the selected covariates for zero slope using a Student's t-test. We estimated the error degrees of freedom for this test with Kenward and Roger's method (Kenward and Roger 1997). We performed the mixed model analysis using SAS version 9.4.

2.9 climate models .

We used climate models projections of the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to generate the input weather data for DSSAT. These climate models simulations are widely used to estimate the effect of the increase in greenhouse gases emissions on climate. The results of climate model simulations are summarized in the IPCC report (AR5). Their resolutions range from 0.75degrees x 0.75degrees to 3.711degrees x 3.75degrees for rainfall and temperatures (Supplementary materials: Table S2).

We tested two climate change scenarios: RCP2.6 is representative of mitigation scenarios aiming at limiting the increase of global mean temperature to 2degreesC. RCP8.5 is representative of scenarios with high greenhouse gas emissions and absence of climate change policies. It leads to the greatest warming among scenarios, exceeding +4degreesC in some regions. Rainfall projections diverge substantially across models, especially for RCP8.5, for which models simulate either an increase or a decrease of rainfall in the future. Climate models do not accurately simulate the penetration of the rain belt during the monsoon season in West Africa (IPCC 2013). This can introduce biases when using the climate simulation with a crop model (Famien et al. 2018). To overcome this, Famien et al. (2018) used the cumulative distribution function transform method to correct GCMs outputs in order to mimic historical precipitation and temperatures with a resolution of 0.5degrees x 0.5degrees for each GCM. We applied this correction on future projections. Precipitation and temperatures simulated by seven climatic models and cor rec ted by Famien e t a l . (2018) were used (supplementary materials: Table S2). We choose seven models for their diversity based on the Monerie classification that groups models according to their simulated rainfall trend in the future (Monerie et al. 2017). Calibration of the climate models was done on years 1979 to 1996 and validation on years 1997-2013. This selection maximizes the spanned range of simulated rainfall for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios for the twenty-first century and allows to explore better the possible climate change scenarios rather than using one median or average scenario.

2.10 ideotype construction .

We used the cultivar coefficients of Nerica 8 (one of the best yielding cultivars in the experiments) as a starting point. We built 16 ideotypes by changing the values of four coefficients as follows: P1 +60 growing degree days, P5 +40 growing degree days, G1+30 spikelet per m2, and THOT + 2degreesC. We explored all combinations of changed/ unchanged coefficients resulting in 42 = 16 virtual cultivars. We explored ideotypes performance in Sinthiou Maleme and Kolda, two contrasting sites representative of the range of environmental conditions found in Senegal for rainfed rice cultivation. Total rainfall at Sinthiou Maleme ranged 600 to 700 mm and soils were sandy (10 % clay + silt). Kolda had wetter conditions (900 to 1000 mm year-1) and heavier soils (16.8 % clay + silt). For the simulations, plant population at seeding was set to 60 plants m-2 and row spacing to 0.6 m. Emergence dates were fixed on 8 July, and fertilization was set to 100 kg N ha-1 (applied at 1, 30, and 60 days after emergence). Independent simulations (i.e., the crop model was reset each year) were carried from 2000 to 2099 for each of the seven climate models. Simulated rice yields were then averaged across the seven climate models and across decades.

3 Results and discussion .

3.1 Statistical analysis of the experiments .

3.1.1 Tests of cultivar, year, and location effect and adjusted means .

The adjusted cultivars, years, and location means for grain yield, anthesis, and maturity dates are shown in Table 4. Results of the tests for cultivar, year, and site effects are listed in Table 4. Cultivar yield varied widely, from 351 (DK17) to 1313 kg ha-1 (NE14). The best yielding cultivar (NE14) had the second shortest growth cycle: on average 57 and 83 days were required to reach anthesis and maturity, respectively. Cultivars with short cycle generally outperformed cultivars with longer cycles.

Fertilization greatly affected grain yield: cutting the recommended doses by 75% (from 80 to 20 kg N ha-1) reduced the average grain yield by 651 kg ha-1. There was a large yield differences between sites and years. Average yield at Darou was 17% of that at Sefa, and average yield dropped by 30% in 2013 and 2014 compared with 2012. By contrast, fertilization, site, and year had little or no effect on flowering and maturity dates. Only one significant genotype x environment interaction (between fertilization and year) was observed (Table 5).

In 2012, a year with good rainfall, yield response to fertilization was greater than in the other years.

3.1.2 Genotypic and environmental drivers of grain yield variability .

Using BIC criterion, the selected cultivar covariates were G1 and THOT. The selected environmental covariates were sowing date, rain 0-60 (cumulated rainfall from 0 to 60 days after sowing), soil N, soil C, and soil clay+silt. In the resulting model, all selected covariates had a significant effect (data not shown). Fertilization had the greatest F-value (Table 5) and was therefore the main controlled effect affecting yield, followed by soil clay+silt and sowing date. The selected covariates helped explain a substantial part of the varietal and environmental random variation: as compared to a model without covariates, the remaining varietal variance was reduced by 56% and the environmental variance by 89%. It means that the full model including the identified covariates captured half of the varietal effects and a large part of the environmental effect. The varietal covariates are included as genetic parameters in CSM-CERES-Rice; environmental covariates are the climate, soil, and crop management inputs of the model. For these reasons, the chosen crop model appears relevant to explore the performance of ideotypes.

The only significant interaction between treatment and environment was the fertilization x year interaction (Table 5). It can be explained by the fertilizer x rainfall interaction. Figure 3 shows the increase in observed and simulated rice yield (averaged per experiment across all cultivars) due to fertilizer (i.e., the difference between yield in F1, 80 kg N ha-1 and yield in F2, 20 kg N ha-1). Variability due to cultivar (verticals error bars in Fig. 3) highlights the varietal diversity in response to fertilizer. The need for simultaneous and adequate supply of
nitrogen and water is recognized worldwide especially in rainfed cereal cropping systems (Cossani et al. 2010). Water and nitrogen stresses interact to limit yields, so that the effect of the combined stress may be lower or greater than the effect of each stresses in isolation (Affholder 1995). For example, the benefits of adequate nitrogen supply for rice thanks to timely fertilizer application can be undermined if water stress occurs during vegetative phase. The large variability in yield response to nitrogen in the context of our study highlights a paradox: fertilizer application offers the promises of doubling rice yield (Table 4), but risk is high that a farmer will not get that yield increase if rainfall is not sufficient, especially at the end of the season after rice flowering. Therefore, policies targeting intensification strategies in such environment should include measures to mitigate those risks (e.g., insurance, weather forecast at different time horizon, crop diversification) .

3.2 climate data .

A delay in monsoon onset and an increase in rainfall in the second period of the monsoon are expected by the end of the century (Biasutti 2013). With RCP8.5, the climate model MIROC-ESM-CHEM belonged to group 1 in Monerie's classification and simulated an increase in rainfall across the West African Sahel up to 20 degreesN and a moderate temperature increase. Group 3, the most populated group in CMIP5 exercise, includes models (HadGEM2-ES and IPSL-CM5A-LR) that predicted a decrease in rainfall in West Africa between 10 and 20degreesN, in relation with the strengthening of the inter-hemispheric SST gradient over the Atlantic with an enhancement of moisture flux convergence. Group 2 models (MPI-ESM-LR and MPI-ESMMR) predicted a slight decrease in rainfall over West African Sahel without a relation with changes in moisture flux convergence but linked locally with changes in moisture recycling. On the other hand, group 4 models (e.g., bcc-csm1-1) depicted a decrease in rainfall across the same region (Monerie et al. 2017). Finally, NorESM1-M simulated an increase in rainfall (May to September).

Temperature projections in Sinthiou Maleme did not diverge substantially between climate models (Supplementary materials: Tables S3 and S4) as well as in Kolda (not shown). Confidence interval for Tmin and Tmax grew from 0.16 and 0.24 in 2000 to 0.21 and 0.57 in 2100, respectively. Projections are more consistent for Tmin than for Tmax, because Tmin is less impacted by cloud changes than Tmax. Climate models with RCP8.5 predicted an increase in Tmin and Tmax of 4.2 and 3.4 degreesC from 2000 to 2100, respectively. This greater increase in Tmin is related to a greater increase in temperature during the night than during the day, a common output of climate models (Lobell et al. 2007). Greater Tmin increases crop night respiration and lowers net photosynthesis. To account for this, crop models need a daily photosynthesis/ respiration module. CSM-CERES-Rice does not have such
module. However, in the latest version, the new cultivar parameter THOT allows to account for heat effect on spikelet sterility, number of grains, and grain yield. There was no clear trend over the century in the global solar radiation. All models predicted more or less 20 MJ m2 day-1 (see Supplementary materials Table S5).

Models diverged with regard to rainfall simulations. For example, ME simulated an increase in annual rainfall over the century with RCP8.5 (Table 6), while the 6 other climate models simulated a decrease. This highlights the need to use an ensemble of climate models to study climate change impacts. Table 6 shows the simulated average decadal rainfall and its confidence interval for the seven climate models from 2000 to 2100 in Sinthiou Maleme. Temperature in the other locations followed similar trends (data not shown). Simulated average daily rainfall from May to November declined at a rate of 0.05 mm year-1. Over 100 years, total rainfall decreased by 50 mm +/- 100 mm on average at that site (Table 6). However, the confidence interval was larger than the expected decrease. This decrease in rainfall will likely cause an increase in drought stress if farmers intensify rice production with more balanced and appropriate nutrient applications. The simulated average decrease in total rainfall hides intra-season differences. The main simulated drop occurred in August: average daily rainfall in this month decreased by 3.9 mm year-1 (data not shown). No reduction in average daily rainfall was expected in October and a very limited one in June (0.5 mm per year, data not shown). Thus, rice sowing date will remain unchanged, and the expected length of growing season from June to October will be similar, but heavy rains in August will be less frequent. Consequently, on one hand, the crop might have enough time to mature before the end of the rainy season. On the other hand, warming will
accelerate crop development. Accordingly, no direct link can be drawn ``a priori'' between a reduction of rainfall amounts and a reduction of yield without the use of a model to simulate soil/climate/management interactions on plant growth, water, and nitrogen availability.

3.3 Crop yields simulations .

3.3.1 Global trends in rice yields .

Figure 4 shows the trends in the decadal average of simulated rice yield with recommended fertilization (80 kg N ha-1) and Nerica 8 for the seven climatic models, with and without the effect of elevated [CO2], for RCP2.6 and 8.5, in Sinthiou Maleme. With RCP2.6 and consideration of CO2 effect, rice yield will increase from 3600 in 2000-2009 to 4500 kg ha-1 in 2090-2099 (Fig. 4a). For all climate model projections (except IL and MM), the crop model predicted an increase in yield.

This ``fertilizing'' effect of CO2 is well known, especially for C3 crops. Though it used to be controversial, it is now supported by recent findings from multiple free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments on soybean, rice, cotton, and wheat (Long et al. 2006). The future increases in crop production caused by the aerial fertilization effect of the atmosphere's rising [CO2] may well be twice as large as what FACE experiments suggest (Bunce 2013). A recent review showed that the effect of elevated [CO2] on C3 crops (Makowski et al. 2020) with adaptation practices can offset the yield decline due to temperature increase (estimated to be 2.4% yield decrease per degreesC increase in temperature), even at +4 degreesC. However, this positive effect cannot offset yield decline caused by temperature increase above 4degreesC (Xiong et al. 2007). Without the effect of elevated [CO2]
(Fig. 4b), simulated rice yield stagnated over the century. Figure 4c and d show trends in decadal average of simulated rice yield for the pessimistic RCP8.5 scenario. This scenario could be realistic given the lack of mitigation effort put in place by the industrial countries driving global emissions. Assuming no adaptation, average simulated rice yield will be divided by two by the end of the century. However, simulated yields differed strongly across climate models. With ME and BC climate models, the crop model simulated an increase in yield from 2700-2800 in 2000s to 3200-3500 kg ha-1in the 2050s, while it predicted a large decrease (below 2000 kg ha-1) with the other climate models. ME and BC simulated more rainfall than the other models (Table 6). ME predicted an increase in average daily rainfall from 3 to 5 mm by the end of the century (Table 6), as a consequence the crop model simulated an increase in rice yield.

3.3.2 Designing ideotypes .

Since crop model simulations with all GCMs predicted a decrease in rice yield in Sinthiou Maleme with RCP8.5 (Fig. 4c and d), breeding for new cultivars that are tolerant and adapted to higher temperatures can contribute to
adaptation of cropping systems. This increase in temperature causes a shortening of rice phenological stages in days. The rainy season will probably have an unchanged start and duration. Relevant adaptation traits include an increase in the thermal time (degree days) to reach flowering or grain filling to regain this loss in crop cycle duration. Higher tolerance to extreme temperature would also help reduce the negative impacts of days with extreme temperature. Higher productivity would also be positive if possible to achieve. Table 7 shows the simulated relative yield increase with 15 ideotypes derived from Nerica 8 for all GCMs with RCP8.5, in Sinthiou Maleme and Kolda. It shows large differences in yield advantage according to ideotypes. In the baseline periods (2000 to 2020, Table 7), a cultivar with a longer vegetative phase (increase in P1) would produce 13-17% more than Nerica 8 in Kolda, and a cultivar with more spikelets or a better tolerance to high temperature (increase in G1 or THOT) would produce 16 % more than Nerica 8 in Sinthiou Maleme. For mid and long term, interactions between ideotypes and future climate are similar in both sites. However, potential increase in yield with the ideotypes with all parameters changed was greater in
Kolda (32% in 2090-2100) than in Sinthiou Maleme (10% in 2090-2100). Cultivars with longer vegetative phase (increase in P1) were more productive than their unmodified counterparts. On the contrary, ideotypes with increased time for grain filling were less productive than their counterparts without changes. By the end of the century, ideotypes with longer time for grain filling (ndegrees 5, 7, 14, and 15) will be more productive. Some ideotypes performed better than Nerica8 at the beginning of the century (e.g., ndegrees1 in Kolda), but this yield advantage decreased over time as climate change became more prominent. Conversely, the two ideotypes with increase in P5, G1, and THOT (ndegrees14 and 15) had lower yield advantage with current climate and greater yield advantage at the end of the century (2050 to 2100), where simulated temperatures were greater. The best ideotype (ndegrees7) had changes in P1, G1, and THOT coefficients: it had a yield advantage and stability in the two locations, regardless of the time period considered.

Cultivars with changes in P5 (grain filling duration) and G1 (number of spikelets) need more time to reach maturity and produce more spikelets. They belong to the new plant type
(NPT) obtained through crosses with japonica types. They have a high sink capacity often not met by carbohydrates offer. Their simulated yield advantage during the first half of the century was negative (see Table 7, ndegrees12, 13, 14, and 15). Interestingly, after 2050, as carbon supply by the atmosphere increased, their yield advantage became positive if THOTwas also increased (ndegrees14 and 15). This interaction between sink strength and source limitations was simulated on irrigated rice by Aggarwal et al. (1997). Our results are also in line with a recent evolutionary analysis over 20,000 years, which concluded that breeding programs and ideotypes construction needed to focus on sink strength capacity (Dingkuhn et al. 2020). Breeders need different genetic engineering toolboxes for the creation of ideotypes with different source-sink and assimilate partitioning. The principle is to match simultaneously photosynthesis carbon offer to a growing demand. For example, modifying T6P genes expression, the regulators of photosynthesis downregulation, and targeting the size and the number of organs were demonstrated to be a promising strategy for maize breeders (Nuccio et al. 2015).

To summarize, we predicted a sharp decline in rainfed rice yield in Senegal under climate change along the twenty-first
century if no climate mitigation and no cropping adaptation occurs. We also showed that, given the range of genetic variability we had in our hand, breeding for new cultivar is possible to get more resilient cultivars. Ideotypes with a longer vegetative phase and a higher sink demand to match the increase in carbon supply by the atmosphere offer a real potential for high yielding and resilient cultivars. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a study using a process-based crop model coupled with an ensemble of global circulation models quantifies the rice yield trends in West Africa under climate change and thoroughly identifies ideotypes to set priorities for breeding programs.

4 conclusions .

In this study, the potential impacts of climate change on rainfed rice yield were assessed for RCP2.6 and 8.5 at different sites representative of a rainfall gradient in Senegal. Our study based on crop model simulations with future climate identified promising ideotypes that can help set priorities for rainfed rice breeding in the region. Farmers currently grow long cycle cultivars, while hybrids with shorter cycles associated with high fertilization rates could yield more with current climate. Climate models predict a decrease in rainfall and an increase in temperature in the future that cause a decline in simulated rice yield if no adaptation occurs. We showed that new cultivars with longer vegetative phase could partially
offset the simulated yield losses. Better tolerance to high temperatures and higher sink capacity with increased number of tillers and spikelets also conferred yield advantage over the current best-performing cultivar. This is the first time that adaptive traits and ideotypes of rainfed rice adapted to current and future conditions inWest Africa are defined in such physiological terms using up-to-date climatic predictions.

Els,"Yield, water productivity and nutrient balances under the System of Rice Intensification and Recommended Management Practices in the Sahel .

Consumer demand for rice in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is increasing faster than for any other cereal. Governments in the Sahel are responding by promoting double-cropping of irrigated rice in the region's river basins, although rising fertilizer and water costs cast doubt on the future profitability of such systems. Despite controversy, the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is widely promoted as a potential solution to this dilemma. SRI includes transplanting young, single seedlings at wide spacing, compost application, mechanical weed control, and alternate wetting and drying irrigation. However, independent evaluation of the system in comparison to an appropriate control is lacking in SSA, and the Sahel in particular. Responding to this need, we compared SRI to flooded rice production following regionally Recommended Management Practices (RMP), in a five-season experiment in the Senegal River Valley. Our objectives were to evaluate yield, water productivity, fertilizer nitrogen recovery efficiency, partial macronutrient balances and soil quality under both management systems. But because compost production in the Sahel is constrained by low labor and biomass availability, we replaced these materials with waste rice straw, and compared the impact of sole mineral fertilizer application to rice straw residue incorporation with fertilizer addition, under both SRI and RMP. In seasons 1-3, fertilizer alone significantly increased yield, with no differences found between management systems. In season 4, beneficial effects of straw incorporation and fertilizer addition were observed, as significant additive increases in yield, straw and fertilizer nitrogen recovery were found for each management system. In season 5, additive benefits were found only for SRI, although SRI yields never exceeded any fertility management treatment under RMP. Across seasons, water savings from 16% to 48% were obtained with SRI, resulting in significant (11%-45%) increases in water productivity. Combined straw incorporation and fertilizer application helped stabilize partial nitrogen and potassium balances across management systems. Compared to controls, straw incorporation also increased total soil nitrogen and carbon. In contrast to the literature on SRI in the Sahel, our findings indicate that when nutrient additions are held constant, significant yield increases should not be expected over conventionally recommended rice crop management systems. However, should farmers choose to experiment with SRI to reduce water use, they would be most likely to benefit from combining rice straw incorporation with mineral fertilizer, although several seasons may be required for additive yield effects to occur.

Among the ecosystems in which rice (Oryza sativa L. and ryza glaberrima Steud.) is grown in Africa, the irrigated environents of the Sahel have the highest yield potential (Seck et al., 010), although large volumes of water are required to offset the

evaporative demand of the hot and arid climate (de Vries et al., 2010). In response to the rapidly expanding consumer demand for rice, 200,000 ha of irrigation facilities reliant on diesel or electrical water pumping have been constructed in the Sahel (Balasubramanian et al., 2007 updated with FAOSTAT, 2012). With a per capita rice consumption rate of 111 kg year-1, Senegal is both the Sahel's and Africa's largest rice importer (FAOSTAT, 2012). Cereal import dependency undermines food security, and increases vulnerability to price shocks, underscoring the need to increase domestic rice productivity (Seck et al., 2010). Raising annual rice output requires exploitation of both wet- and dry-season production. However, Senegalese

armers face increasing input costs due to reductions in ferilizer subsidies and rising fuel prices. Because of increases in he latter, irrigation costs comprise 21-45% of farmers' budgets Krupnik et al., 2012). Combined with increasing municipal water emand and predictions of climate-change induced water scarcity Lahtela, 2003), improving water productivity in Sahelian irriated rice has become an important objective (de Vries et al., 010).

Numerous water-saving technologies for rice have been valiated in Asia, though they remain relatively untested and are not et recommended anywhere in Africa. Most notable are aerobic ice (e.g. Bouman et al., 2007), alternate wetting and drying, or WD (e.g. Belder et al., 2005), and the System of Rice Intensifiation, or SRI (Uphoff et al., 2010). Of these, SRI has attracted the ost attention. SRI techniques include line transplanting of single oung seedlings at wide spacing, mechanical weed control, AWD rrigation, and the application of organic soil fertility amendments, referably compost or manure. SRI's advocates argue these techiques provide very high yields and improve water productivity Uphoff et al., 2010). SRI is now supported by institutions ranging rom farmers' organizations to NGOs and the World Bank, and is romoted in 47 countries globally (CIIFAD, 2011), though its poplarity has not come without controversy. For example, McDonald t al. (2006) argued that SRI yields were no higher than Recomended Management Practices (RMP), and this suggestion spurred onsiderable debate (see McDonald et al., 2008; Uphoff et al., 008).

In addition to yield performance, SRI promotion focuses on ssertions of increased water and nutrient use efficiency. However, eer-reviewed studies presenting scientifically sound data to suport these claims are scant in Africa, while the little work that has een done entails conflicting results. In Mozambique, for example, enete et al. (2008) recorded a 41-46% yield depression on saltffected soils with SRI; while in Madagascar, Barison and Uphoff 2010) documented higher macronutrient recovery and yield comared to farmers' practices. In another study in the same location, RI yields as high as 9.9 t ha-1 were recorded, though rather than ttributing them to SRI per se, Tsujimoto et al. (2009) suggested hey resulted from repetitive, deep tillage and incorporation of up o 35 t compost ha-1 (dry weight equivalent). In the Sahel, interest n SRI has grown following reports of 66% yield increases, 10% water avings, and a doubling of farmers' revenues in Mali (Styger et al., 010), though they compared SRI to current, lower-bound farmers' ractices alone, thereby avoiding comparison to an upper-bound MP control. As McDonald et al. (2006) suggested, the latter pracice could have given similar, if not more favorable results than RI.

To make such a comparison, we present five seasons of results rom an experiment evaluating yield, water productivity, nitroen recovery efficiencies, partial macronutrient balances and soil uality effects of both SRI and RMP. Manure or compost are preerred fertility inputs in SRI. In Mali, for instance, single-season valuations of SRI have used up to 13 t ha-1 of manure in addiion to chemical fertilizers (Styger et al., 2010). However, in the roader Sahel, where compost production and manure applicaion are constrained by low biomass and labor availability, the eason-to-season sustainability of such high application rates is uestionable.

In order to adapt this SRI component to local circumstances, we nstead compared the impact of sole fertilizer application, to fertilzer combined with waste rice straw incorporation as an organic
atter input, in both SRI and RMP. We hypothesized that with qual nutrient additions, yields in the first few seasons of the xperiment would not differ significantly between crop manageent systems. However, we expected that SRI would demonstrate igher water productivity, with stronger yield benefits resulting

from straw incorporation and fertilizer addition in the long term, due to increased soil aeration and more rapid residue decomposition under AWD.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Site description
A field experiment was conducted at the Africa Rice Center's Regional Sahel Station at Ndiaye in the Senegal River delta (16o11'N, 16o15'W). Trials were conducted in both the dry and wet season, spanning the 2007-2009 wet seasons. Climate data were collected 300 m from the experiment in a cropped rice field (Fig. 1). Ndiaye's soil is an Orhithionic Gleysol (FAO, 2006), and is comprised of oceanic sediments overlain by alluvial deposits. Texture (0-20 cm) is 16-44-40% sand, silt and clay (Haefele, 2001). Although subsoil materials of marine origin can cause serious soil salinity problems in the region (Ceuppens et al., 1997), initial electrical conductivity was low. Soil properties before the experiment were 0.87 g total N kg-1 and 9.6 g total C kg-1 (analysis with a Vario Max Dry Combustion Analyzer, Elementar Americas, Mt. Laurel, NJ following the IOS (1998)), 5.81 kg P-Olsen kg-1 (measured following extraction in 0.5 M NaHCO3 at pH 8.5 (Olsen et al., 1954)), 0.47 cmol exchangeable K kg-1 (atomic absorption spectroscopy after extraction in 1 M NH4OAc at pH 7), pH of 4.76 (1:2.5 H20 saturated paste) and EC 0.33 dS m-1 (1:5 H20 saturated paste).
2.2. Experimental design and establishment
A split-plot experiment with four replicates was established. Main plots were crop management systems, RMP and SRI (Table 1). Sub-plots measured 25 m2, and consisted of four randomized treatments:
1. A no straw or mineral fertilizer additions control treatment (-ST-F). 2. A straw-only control treatment with 5 t ha-1 (dry weight) rice straw incorporated before transplanting, but without mineral fertilizer (+ST-F). 3. Mineral fertilizer only (-St+F). 4. Rice straw incorporation at the same rate and timing as the straw
only control followed by mineral fertilizer application (+ST+F).

In plots receiving fertilizer, DAP was applied basally (19.3 and 21.5 kg N and P ha-1), and three urea splits were broadcasted into 1-5 cm of water (101.3 kg N ha-1; 40% at early-tillering, 40% at panicle initiation, and 20% at heading). Fertilizer K is generally not recommended by extension officials because of high soil-K reserves (Haefele et al., 2004), and was therefore excluded. Before the experiment, soils were ploughed and disk-harrowed, after which bunds were constructed to isolate main plots. An additional bund was built to contain sub-plots within main plots, and plastic sheeting was installed over all main and sub-plot bunds to 0.5 m depth to eliminate seepage. A 4 m space was also maintained between main plots to prevent lateral water movement.

In the 2007 wet season, rice straw obtained from a neighboring farm was incorporated (0-15 cm depth) into damp soil with a hoe 15 days before transplanting, after which plots were leveled. In subsequent seasons, straw was incorporated 19-21 days before transplanting. Straw N and C concentrations were determined by combustion (Vario Max N/C Analyzer, Elementar Americas, Mt. Laurel, NJ, Table 2). Phosphorus and potassium were determined following Yoshida et al. (1976) and Walinga et al. (1989). The short-duration O. sativa cultivar Sahel-108 (IR-13240-1082-2-3) was grown during all seasons. Transplanting for both

anagement systems took place on 7 (2007 and 2008 wet season) nd 25 (2009 wet season) August and on 19 March (2008 and 2009 ry season).
.3. Water inflows and water table depths
Water used for seedbeds, land preparation and postransplanting irrigation was quantified by recording the height f water passing through V-notched weirs placed at the inlet of eedbeds and main plots, at 1-min intervals for seedbeds, and -min intervals for main-plots, respectively. After passage through he weir, water was equally distributed to sub-plots. Irrigation was alculated as:
= 13.8 tan
( ) H2.5 (1)
here Q is water discharged (l min-1), is the angle of the weir, and is the water head level (cm) measured before passing through the -notch (USBR, 2001). Q was combined with precipitation and conerted to m3 of water ha-1 applied for the entire season. Field water eight within sub-plots was measured daily in open-ended, perfoated PVC tubes (30 cm diameter). Ground water depths (0-1.5 m) utside experimental plots were similarly monitored with 12 PVC ubes (6 cm diameter), each placed 4 m from main plots. Percolaion in RMP sub-plots was measured in 60 cm long closed tubes (30 iameter) placed into the subsoil until 45 cm depth. Drainage volme was calculated as the difference in standing field water height mmediately before and after drainage events, multiplied by plot urface area.
.4. Chemical composition of irrigation, flood and rainwater
When a floodwater layer was present, EC was measured at least wice weekly with a portable meter. Water mineral N concenrations were determined during irrigation from a sample taken mmediately before V-notched weirs. Samples were placed on ice, eturned to the lab and filtered through Whatman No. 42 paper. H4 + and NO3 - concentrations were subsequently measured with n auto-analyzer (Seal Analytical, Mequon, WI) following Andersen nd Ingram (1989). Precipitation and floodwater samples, the later collected immediately before drainage events, were analyzed n the same way. Mean irrigation, flood and rainwater mineral N oncentrations were 1.3, 1.7 and 3.6 mg l-1, respectively. Based n previous studies on the same experimental site (Faye, 1996; aefele, 2001; Samba Diene, 1998), P and K concentrations in irrigaion and floodwater were estimated at 0.1 mg P l-1 and 3.2 mg K l-1. verage rainwater P and K concentrations were derived from hornton (1965) and Peri (1985) as 0.03 mg P l-1 and 1.0 mg K l-1.
.5. Soil and plant sampling
Prior to the onset and at the very end of the five-season experment (hence before straw incorporation in the 2007 wet season, nd at harvest of the 2009 wet season), five soil cores (0-15 cm epth) were taken from each plot to assess total N and C, P-Olsen, xchangeable K, pH and EC.

2.6. Data analysis
Water productivity of irrigation and rainwater (WP, kg grain m-3 water) was calculated for main-effects as:
Y
I + P (2)
where Y is grain yield (kg ha-1), I is irrigation and P is precipitation (m3) summed for seedbeds, land preparation and the post-transplanting period. The recovery of N derived from incorporated rice straw without fertilizer application was calculated as:
N+ST-F-N-ST-F
STN (3)
where N+ST-F is N in rice biomass (grain N + straw N) ha-1 in the straw-only sub-treatment, N-ST-F is rice biomass N ha-1 in the no straw or fertilizer additions sub-treatment, and STN is kg N ha-1 applied in incorporated rice straw. Conversely, the recovery of N derived from straw when incorporated with fertilizer was calculated as:
N+ST+F-N-ST+F
STN (4)
where N+ST+F is rice biomass N ha-1 in the straw and fertilizer amended sub-treatment and N-ST+F is rice biomass N ha-1 in subtreatments receiving fertilizer only. The recovery of fertilizer N when applied without straw incorporation was next quantified as:
N-ST+F-N-ST-F
FN (5)
with FN being kg fertilizer N applied ha-1. Finally, the recovery of fertilizer N when applied following straw incorporation was calculated as:
N+ST+F-N+ST-F
FN (6)
Partial N-P-K balances over five seasons were estimated as the summed total of N-P-K inputs from mineral fertilizers, straw application, wet deposition and irrigation, minus the sum of N-P-K exports in harvested grain and straw, and in drainage water.

Data for each season were checked for homoscedasticity and normality following Sokal and Rohlf (1995), and analyzed using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS Institute Inc., San Francisco). Yield, nutrient uptake and recovery, water productivity, and soil quality data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant results for separate tests of fertilizer and straw application followed by non-significant interactions indicate additive effects, whereas significant interactions indicate either negative or synergistic effects. When additive or synergistic effects were observed, main management system effects were analyzed.
3. Results
3.1. Grain yield
In the first three experimental seasons, the only significant yield effect was in response to fertilizer application (P < 0.001 for seasons 1-3), which increased yields by an average of 1.7 (2007 wet season), 3.4 (2008 dry season) and 2.6 t ha-1 (2008 wet season) across management systems (Fig. 2). No seasonal differences in yield were observed. In the 2009 dry season, significant management system x fertilizer (P < 0.05) and management system x fertilizer x straw interactions were observed (P < 0.05). Fertilizer application in SRI increased yield by 3.3 and 3.8 t ha-1 when applied alone and in combination with straw, respectively, relative to 3.1 and 2.2 t ha-1 in RMP. The three-way management system x fertilizer x straw interaction was caused by low SRI

ST+F yield, while yield under the same RMP sub-treatment was 0% less than SRI. Both straw and fertilizer application had sigificant yield effects (P < 0.001), though their interaction remained on-significant, indicating additive benefits from their combinaion under both management systems, starting four seasons after traw incorporation began.

In the fifth and final season, a significant system x straw incororation effect (P < 0.001) resulted from higher yields in the +ST-F ub-treatment (4.1 t ha-1) and lower +ST+F yields (6.9 t ha-1) under MP relative to SRI (3.8 and 7.3 t ha-1 for the same treatments). n contrast to previous seasons where only fertilizer significantly ncreased yields, when SRI alone was subject to an ANOVA, -ST-F, ST-F, -ST+F and +ST+F yields were all significantly different P < 0.05), and increased with N application from straw and ferilizers (Fig. 2). In contrast, yields under RMP reverted to a similar attern as the first three seasons, with significant increases only n response to fertilizer (P < 0.001). RMP -ST+F yields were also ignificantly different (P < 0.05) and 22% greater than the correponding SRI sub-treatment. However, no yield differences were ound between management systems when comparing the +ST+F ub-treatment. While a significant additive effect (P < 0.001) of ombined fertilizer and straw application was observed, it occurred nly for SRI. Significant differences between management systems ere also recorded in the last season (P = 0.014), with RMP yieldng slightly more (+0.3 t ha-1) than SRI when averaged across all ub-treatments.
.2. Water management and water productivity
Water inflows to SRI were always significantly less than under MP (P < 0.001 for all seasons). Savings tended to be greater in the ry season, when evaporative demand was higher. The total seaonal volume of irrigation and precipitation used in RMP ranged rom 7537 to 15,632 m3 ha-1 compared to 6345-10,055 m3 ha-1 in RI across seasons (Table 3).

In RMP, field water levels were consistently above the soil surace, with the exception of the first few days after transplanting
hen plots were left moist but not flooded to facilitate seedling
stablishment, and when drainage was performed for herbicide pplication (Fig. 3). Conversely, there was no floodwater in SRI for 2, 52, 53, 54 and 26% of the days in each season from the 2007

wet season to the 2009 dry season. The 2009 wet season had the lowest number of completely non-flooded days because a series of heavy rainfall events raised water levels in exit canals, thereby inhibiting effective drainage. Percolation in RMP was consistently less than 2.2 mm day-1 in RMP, regardless of seasons (data not shown). In general, below-surface field water depths did not exceed -12 cm under SRI, whereas the maximum above surface floodwater measurement was 6 cm. Soil volumetric water content under SRI remained generally higher than 30%, even during non-flooded periods.

Reduced irrigation volume under SRI resulted in consistently and significantly higher WP compared to RMP, ranging from 11% to 45% across seasons (Table 4). No significant correlations between yield and water use were found for either crop management system, and floodwater EC remained consistently below 0.9 dS m-1 across seasons, regardless of treatment (data not shown).
3.3. Nutrient dynamics
3.3.1. Nutrient uptake from straw and fertilizer Fertilizer application alone had a significant positive effect on crop N, P and K uptake in total biomass measured at harvest during the first three experimental seasons (P < 0.001 for each season). In the 2009 dry season, no difference between management systems in uptake of any macronutrient was found. Both fertilizer and straw application significantly increased N, P and K uptake in SRI and RMP during this season (Fig. 4). The occurrence of a significant fertilizer x straw interaction (P < 0.05) for N uptake also indicated synergistic effects resulting from the combination of fertilizer and straw application under both management systems. Conversely, P and K uptake effects remained additive. In the subsequent 2009 wet season, N uptake in grain and straw, averaged across subtreatments, was significantly less in SRI than in RMP (P < 0.01). Significantly (P < 0.05) less fertilizer N (25 kg ha-1) was taken up in the -ST+F treatment in the former as opposed to latter management system (Fig. 4). In contrast, the combination of fertilizer and straw application resulted in similar N uptake for both management systems. Fertilizer application had significant yield effects in RMP, while straw incorporation did not show any significant effect. Conversely, both fertilizer and straw incorporation were significant under SRI, while their interaction was not. Additive effects therefore occurred under SRI only (Fig. 4). The same additive trend was T.J. K Rupnik et al. / Field Crops R Esearch 130 (2012) 155-167

Under these circumstances, the recovery of straw N exceeded 0.9 kg N kg N-1 for both management systems. This pattern shifted in the 2009 wet season, during which a significant management system x straw interaction (P < 0.01) and significant main effects (P < 0.01) were caused by a very high recovery of straw N at harvest

In the fourth season, straw incorporation followed by fertilizer application increased the recovery of fertilizer N to 0.43 kg N kg N-1 across management systems. Fertilizer N recovery was also significantly (P < 0.01) higher in SRI compared to RMP (a difference of 0.09 kg N kg N-1), driven by increased recovery in both -ST+F and +ST+F sub-treatments. In the fifth season, a significant management system x fertilizer interaction was observed (P < 0.05), with the recovery of fertilizer N in +ST+F plots reaching 0.64 kg N kg N-1 compared to 0.46 kg N kg N-1 in the -ST+F

.4. Partial nutrient balances and soil quality after five cropping easons
.4.1. Partial nutrient balances No significant main effects were found on partial macronutrint balances after five seasons of consecutive cropping. However, hen no fertilizer or straw was applied, highly negative balances ere found under both management systems for N, P and K (Fig. 5). n comparison, straw and fertilizer application each resulted in ignificant and positive N balances measured across management ystems (P < 0.001). Straw application had no effect on P balnces, while fertilizer addition had a small but significant impact P < 0.001), moving P balances towards the positive in RMP and SRI.
ith the exception of the +ST-F sub-treatment, K balances were onsistently negative, irrespective of management system. Relative o controls, highly significant differences were found for K under oth -ST+F and +F+ST sub-treatments (P < 0.001). Under both mangement systems, the negative balance was less severe under the atter treatment (+F+ST). Because SRI used less water during each eason (Table 3), RMP received on average more nutrients via irriation water than SRI over five seasons (72 vs. 46 kg N ha-1, 5 vs.
kg P ha-1 and 167 vs. 114 kg K ha-1). Precipitation imported an stimated 27 kg N, 0.08 kg P and 8 kg K ha-1 to both RMP and SRI lots over the course of five seasons (Fig. 5).
.4.2. Soil quality parameters No significant effects of crop management system, crop
anagement system x fertilizer application, crop manageent system x straw application, nor crop management ystem x fertilizer x straw application were found on soil total N r C, P-Olsen or exchangeable K after five seasons of continuous ropping (Table 6). But when measured across crop management ystems, straw incorporation significantly (P < 0.05) increased total
(with 17%), total C (with 15%) and exchangeable K (with 11%) ompared to non-fertilized (no fertilizer no straw) plots, respecively. Fertilizer application had a near-significant impact on vailable P (P = 0.054), increasing P-Olsen by 21% to 6.9 mg P kg-1. here were no significant differences in soil pH (range 4.7-6.7)
or EC (range 0.40-1.70 dS m-1) between management systems or sub-treatments, although when compared to baseline data taken in 2007 and measured across all plots, the final values for both pH and EC increased by 16% and 215% to means of 5.51 and 1.02 dS m-1 for both parameters (P < 0.001, data not shown).
4. Discussion
4.1. Yield, water savings and water productivity
Water savings ranging from 16%-48% were obtained under SRI in this study, resulting in increased water productivity compared to RMP. In only two of 20 observed cases SRI yields were significantly lower than in comparable RMP sub-treatments (under -ST-F and -ST+F in the 2009 wet season). But while SRI increased water savings and water productivity, no sustained yield or nutrient recovery advantages were found in comparison to any RMP sub-treatment.

Our results therefore indicate that while there is potential for water saving, farmers in the study region are unlikely to realize yield advantages with SRI compared to other improved crop management options when nutrient additions are held constant. This confirms McDonald et al. (2006, 2008), who suggested that SRI's yield benefits were likely to be limited when compared to an appropriate, upper-bound control system. Our results contrast with reports of high-yielding SRI performance in the Sahel where the SRI was compared to lower-bound farmers' practice controls alone, and with highly unequal nutrient additions (e.g. Styger et Al., 2010). Nonetheless, should farmers choose to experiment SRI to save water, our results show that they would be more likely to benefit over the long-term from combined organic matter (straw) and fertilizer application compared to mineral nutrient additions alone.

Reports of increased water productivity with SRI are common in field station experiments (e.g. Zhao Et Al., 2009). But under on-farm conditions, poor land leveling may increase the risk of submergence and plant loss in field depressions where farmers transplant only single, young seedlings and attempt to practice AWD (Krupnik et al., 2012). Similarly, higher field positions may not receive sufficient water and experience increased weed infestation (Rodenburg and Johnson, 2009). Caution should therefore be employed when extrapolating the results of this and other on-station studies to on-farm situations.

RMP) and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) under four fertility treatments ertilizer) in Ndiaye, Senegal. Because plots were rarely drained, drainage values fo ess than 5 kg ha-1 in total.

Ground water depths during the cropping season were generally etween -30 and -70 cm. SRI field water depths never exceeded 12 cm, above the maximum 15 cm depth for ``safe'' AWD with inimal risk of yield loss (Bouman et al., 2007). No correlations
etween water use and yield were observed, indicating that the oot zone in SRI plots was usually either moist or saturated, and hat drought stress was not encountered. Indeed, volumetric water ontent of soils under SRI was generally higher than 30% (data not hown), well above the permanent wilting point of 25% established or this soil by de Vries et al. (2010).

In landscapes with relatively shallow water tables, for examle in riverside depressions as in this study, or in large irrigation chemes with shallow water tables, Belder et al. (2004, 2005) sugested that water savings between 10% and 30% should be possible sing AWD with little yield penalty because rice roots can access ufficient soil moisture from capillary rise. Water-saving potential s also high on finely textured soils (Belder et al., 2007), such as hose in the current study site. Where soils are coarser, or fields re located in more isolated or higher-elevation irrigation schemes, aving water without reducing yield can be more difficult (Tabbal t al., 2002). In the 2009 dry season, very high water savings (48%) ere observed under SRI without significant yield loss compared to MP. Tuong et al. (1994) showed that small-plot experiments with ow bund to surface area ratios can result in unreasonably high eepage rates and exaggeration of estimated water requirements n flooded treatments. Though the bund to area ratio of sub-plots in his experiment was relatively small (0.7 m m-2), we maintain that

water savings are unlikely to have been overestimated because: (i) seepage was minimized by lining bunds with plastic sheeting and installing them into the soil below the plough layer, (ii) bund over-flow was never observed, and (iii) percolation in RMP was low. Also, (iv) evaporative losses are generally higher from ponded water compared to soil surfaces (Belder et al., 2005), and field water levels in SRI were below the surface for 54% of the time for this season. Thus, the water savings observed likely resulted from reduced seepage, careful irrigation in SRI, and higher evaporative floodwater losses from RMP.

The build-up of alkaline salts could also constrain yield in watersaving management systems in the Sahel (de Vries et al., 2010). In this experiment, soil EC increased dramatically after five seasons, confirming previous observations of the impact of double-cropping at the same site (Haefele et al., 2004). However, EC remained well below the threshold of 2.0 dS m-1 after which yield might be affected (Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000), and no differences were found between management systems. But because saline deposits are heterogeneously distributed (Ceuppens et al., 1997), further and longer-term research on the potential interaction between AWD irrigation and salinity should be undertaken.

Despite the water productivity advantages of SRI demonstrated in this study, it must be recognized that SRI is by no means the only method to save water without compromising yield. Evidence of good water savings in conventional management systems where AWD alone is implemented, but where crop establishment, weed and nutrient management remain relatively unchanged compared

Sanjeewanie nd Ranamukharrachchi (2009) contrasted SRI with direct seeding sing AWD in Thailand. Both yield and water productivity were ighest with the latter system. Clearly, further research is needed to racket SRI's performance compared to other management options hat reduce water use.
.2. Recovery of straw and fertilizer nitrogen
Despite the potential for immobilization of fertilizer N when traw residues are incorporated, no negative effects on N uptake ere observed for either system during seasons 1-3 of this experment. In the fourth season, additive N-P-K uptake effects were ound for both crop management systems, but in the fifth and final eason, they were recorded only for SRI. It is not uncommon for sevral seasons to pass before straw incorporation positively affects ield in irrigated rice (Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2005). Delays may esult from the gradual build-up of soil nutrient pools with the susained addition of residues (e.g. Eagle et al., 2000), although when ompared to higher and more balanced mineral N-P-K rates, yield ncreases due to combined organic matter and fertilizer applicaions may not be significant (Dawe et al., 2003). In contrast, the ST+F sub-treatment affected macronutrient uptake more posiively with SRI than RMP in the current study. This suggests that esource-poor farmers unable to afford balanced N-P-K fertilizers ho experiment with SRI could gain from this fertility management trategy, although beneficial effects may only occur after several easons.

The additive SRI yield effects resulting from combined fertilizer nd straw application in the last two seasons of this study can be artially explained by improved recovery both of straw and fertilzer N. In the fourth season, straw N recovery was higher under ST+F compared to +ST-F (a difference of 17 kg ha-1 under SRI nd 7 kg ha-1 under RMP). SRI advocates argue that combined with WD, mechanical weeding aerates the soil and increases N minralization and supply to the crop (Ceesay, 2010; Uphoff et al., 010). However, the improved N uptake and recovery observed n this experiment is unlikely to have been caused by increased oil aeration. Despite the AWD regime, the soil water-status in SRI emained close to saturation. Moreover, volumetric water contents fter weeding tended to be higher than before, because irrigation ad to be introduced to facilitate the movement of rotary weeders. onversely, mechanical weeding may have stimulated mineralizaion by tearing straw into smaller pieces and increasing residue urface area exposed to microbial attack, though additional work is equired to confirm this hypothesis. The recovery of straw N in the ST+F sub-treatment was above 100% in the 2009 wet season, indiating that part of the recovered N was obtained from the labile oil N pool, which was probably augmented through the gradual ecycling of straw N incorporated over the previous four seasons. owever, while improved fertilizer N recovery under SRI has been eported elsewhere (Zhao et al., 2009), it was never statistically uperior to RMP in the current experiment.
.3. Long-term impact on macronutrient balances and soil quality
Both fertilizer and straw inputs, and grain and straw exports, xerted the largest effect on post-experiment partial macronutrient alances in this study. Fertilizer and straw application each posiively affected N balances. Rice straw contains little P, so P balances ere mainly increased by fertilizer alone. And although no fertilzer K was applied, both fertilizer and straw significantly impacted balances. Fertilizer N and P moved K balances towards the negaive because of increased crop growth and uptake of indigenous soil , although in all treatments soil exchangeable K remained above
earch 130 (2012) 155-167 165
the medium K status threshold of 0.45 cmol kg-1, below which fertilizer K might affect yield (Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000). Moreover, no treatment effects on grain or straw K concentrations were observed at harvest in the last season, and levels of each remained above deficiency thresholds according to Dobermann and Fairhurst (2000). But because straw contains large amounts of K, incorporation in +ST-F and +ST+F treatments helped to offset declining partial K balances.

While KCl fertilizer is recommended for double-cropping (Bado et al., 2010), high costs prohibit its use in the Sahel. Haefele et al. (2004) suggested that fertilizer K may not be necessary because equilibrium reactions between exchangeable and high total K reserves in West Africa's river floodplain soils could maintain levels above the critical limit for decades. While this is advantageous for resource-poor farmers unable to afford fertilizer K, we suggest that straw incorporation in double-cropped systems will help to offset losses, thereby prolonging depletion over longer periods of time, thus improving the long-term sustainability of rice cropping. Further research should be conducted to determine if recommended KCl application rates could be reduced where farmers incorporate rice straw, as reduced fertilizer K requirements would make KCl application more affordable, while also helping to maintain soil quality. Future studies should also examine in situ recycling of straw, as opposed to biomass importation as used in the current study. Finally, when measured at the conclusion of the experiment, straw incorporation led to small yet significant increases in total soil C and N compared to controls, arguably improving soil quality in each crop management system. Straw incorporation also supplies micronutrients (Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2005), which we were unable to examine in this study, potentially providing additional agronomic benefits.

Post-experiment estimates of partial macronutrient balances suggested slightly more positive trends for RMP compared to SRI, in part because of greater nutrient inputs through irrigation, although differences were never significant. But in water-saving systems more reliant on drainage, or where less irrigation is needed, differences could be larger. We estimated P and K concentrations in irrigation, rain and floodwater based on previous studies at the same location. Balances may therefore be slightly less accurate than desirable, although significant error is unlikely because concentrations fell within the bounds of the ranges reported in the literature (see Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000). Conversely, gaseous N losses, biological N fixation, leaching, inter-season capillary rise, and dry deposition also play a role in nutrient cycling (Cassman et al., 1998; Haefele, 2001), though we were unable to account for them in this study. Nutrient losses via leaching, however, are unlikely to be large in lowland rice fields (Cassman et al., 1998), especially where soils are finely textured and where water tables remain close to the soil surface. This study therefore provides a first-step towards estimating irrigation, wet deposition, and flood water drainage import and export pathways that are typically not included in partial nutrient balance studies. Additional work is needed to quantify the gaps described above, especially in double-cropped, water-saving rice systems, where import and export pathways could significantly differ.
5. Conclusion
We investigated the potential for water savings and the impact of organic (straw) and inorganic soil fertility amendments on yields and nutrient balances under Recommended Management Practices and the System of Rice Intensification over five seasons in the Senegal River Delta. Our results indicate that substantial water savings and increases in water productivity can be obtained with SRI, although significant yield increases compared to RMP should

ot be expected. Positive effects resulting from straw incorporation ollowed by fertilizer application became apparent in the fourth eason as significant additive increases in yield, straw and fertilizer
recovery were observed under both RMP and SRI. However, coninuation of these trends was only observed for SRI in the fifth and nal season of the experiment, suggesting that integrated organic nd mineral nutrient management of soil fertility is more advanageous with SRI than RMP. Fertilizer and straw additions also had
positive effect on partial macronutrient balances and soil qualty parameters. Further work should be conducted to investigate he mechanisms underlying these results, and to compare SRI's ield and water productivity performance to other water-saving ice management systems. If farmers in the Sahel practicing doubleropping choose to experiment with techniques like SRI to reduce ater use and thus input costs, our findings indicate that they are ost likely to benefit over time by practicing straw residue incororation followed by mineral fertilizer additions, although when utrient additions are held equal, SRI is unlikely to improve yield rends over long-established Recommended Management Pracices.

Yield, water productivity and nutrient balances under the System of Rice Intensification and Recommended Management Practices in the Sahel .

Consumer demand for rice in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is increasing faster than for any other cereal. Governments in the Sahel are responding by promoting double-cropping of irrigated rice in the region's river basins, although rising fertilizer and water costs cast doubt on the future profitability of such systems. Despite controversy, the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is widely promoted as a potential solution to this dilemma. SRI includes transplanting young, single seedlings at wide spacing, compost application, mechanical weed control, and alternate wetting and drying irrigation. However, independent evaluation of the system in comparison to an appropriate control is lacking in SSA, and the Sahel in particular. Responding to this need, we compared SRI to flooded rice production following regionally Recommended Management Practices (RMP), in a five-season experiment in the Senegal River Valley. Our objectives were to evaluate yield, water productivity, fertilizer nitrogen recovery efficiency, partial macronutrient balances and soil quality under both management systems. But because compost production in the Sahel is constrained by low labor and biomass availability, we replaced these materials with waste rice straw, and compared the impact of sole mineral fertilizer application to rice straw residue incorporation with fertilizer addition, under both SRI and RMP. In seasons 1-3, fertilizer alone significantly increased yield, with no differences found between management systems. In season 4, beneficial effects of straw incorporation and fertilizer addition were observed, as significant additive increases in yield, straw and fertilizer nitrogen recovery were found for each management system. In season 5, additive benefits were found only for SRI, although SRI yields never exceeded any fertility management treatment under RMP. Across seasons, water savings from 16% to 48% were obtained with SRI, resulting in significant (11%-45%) increases in water productivity. Combined straw incorporation and fertilizer application helped stabilize partial nitrogen and potassium balances across management systems. Compared to controls, straw incorporation also increased total soil nitrogen and carbon. In contrast to the literature on SRI in the Sahel, our findings indicate that when nutrient additions are held constant, significant yield increases should not be expected over conventionally recommended rice crop management systems. However, should farmers choose to experiment with SRI to reduce water use, they would be most likely to benefit from combining rice straw incorporation with mineral fertilizer, although several seasons may be required for additive yield effects to occur.

. Introduction
Among the ecosystems in which rice (Oryza sativa L. and ryza glaberrima Steud.) is grown in Africa, the irrigated environents of the Sahel have the highest yield potential (Seck et al., 010), although large volumes of water are required to offset the

evaporative demand of the hot and arid climate (de Vries et al., 2010). In response to the rapidly expanding consumer demand for rice, 200,000 ha of irrigation facilities reliant on diesel or electrical water pumping have been constructed in the Sahel (Balasubramanian et al., 2007 updated with FAOSTAT, 2012). With a per capita rice consumption rate of 111 kg year-1, Senegal is both the Sahel's and Africa's largest rice importer (FAOSTAT, 2012). Cereal import dependency undermines food security, and increases vulnerability to price shocks, underscoring the need to increase domestic rice productivity (Seck et al., 2010). Raising annual rice output requires exploitation of both wet- and dry-season production. However, Senegalese

armers face increasing input costs due to reductions in ferilizer subsidies and rising fuel prices. Because of increases in he latter, irrigation costs comprise 21-45% of farmers' budgets Krupnik et al., 2012). Combined with increasing municipal water emand and predictions of climate-change induced water scarcity Lahtela, 2003), improving water productivity in Sahelian irriated rice has become an important objective (de Vries et al., 010).

Numerous water-saving technologies for rice have been valiated in Asia, though they remain relatively untested and are not et recommended anywhere in Africa. Most notable are aerobic ice (e.g. Bouman et al., 2007), alternate wetting and drying, or WD (e.g. Belder et al., 2005), and the System of Rice Intensifiation, or SRI (Uphoff et al., 2010). Of these, SRI has attracted the ost attention. SRI techniques include line transplanting of single oung seedlings at wide spacing, mechanical weed control, AWD rrigation, and the application of organic soil fertility amendments, referably compost or manure. SRI's advocates argue these techiques provide very high yields and improve water productivity Uphoff et al., 2010). SRI is now supported by institutions ranging rom farmers' organizations to NGOs and the World Bank, and is romoted in 47 countries globally (CIIFAD, 2011), though its poplarity has not come without controversy. For example, McDonald t al. (2006) argued that SRI yields were no higher than Recomended Management Practices (RMP), and this suggestion spurred onsiderable debate (see McDonald et al., 2008; Uphoff et al., 008).

In addition to yield performance, SRI promotion focuses on ssertions of increased water and nutrient use efficiency. However, eer-reviewed studies presenting scientifically sound data to suport these claims are scant in Africa, while the little work that has een done entails conflicting results. In Mozambique, for example, enete et al. (2008) recorded a 41-46% yield depression on saltffected soils with SRI; while in Madagascar, Barison and Uphoff 2010) documented higher macronutrient recovery and yield comared to farmers' practices. In another study in the same location, RI yields as high as 9.9 t ha-1 were recorded, though rather than ttributing them to SRI per se, Tsujimoto et al. (2009) suggested hey resulted from repetitive, deep tillage and incorporation of up o 35 t compost ha-1 (dry weight equivalent). In the Sahel, interest n SRI has grown following reports of 66% yield increases, 10% water avings, and a doubling of farmers' revenues in Mali (Styger et al., 010), though they compared SRI to current, lower-bound farmers' ractices alone, thereby avoiding comparison to an upper-bound MP control. As McDonald et al. (2006) suggested, the latter pracice could have given similar, if not more favorable results than RI.

To make such a comparison, we present five seasons of results rom an experiment evaluating yield, water productivity, nitroen recovery efficiencies, partial macronutrient balances and soil uality effects of both SRI and RMP. Manure or compost are preerred fertility inputs in SRI. In Mali, for instance, single-season valuations of SRI have used up to 13 t ha-1 of manure in addiion to chemical fertilizers (Styger et al., 2010). However, in the roader Sahel, where compost production and manure applicaion are constrained by low biomass and labor availability, the eason-to-season sustainability of such high application rates is uestionable.

In order to adapt this SRI component to local circumstances, we nstead compared the impact of sole fertilizer application, to fertilzer combined with waste rice straw incorporation as an organic
atter input, in both SRI and RMP. We hypothesized that with qual nutrient additions, yields in the first few seasons of the xperiment would not differ significantly between crop manageent systems. However, we expected that SRI would demonstrate igher water productivity, with stronger yield benefits resulting

from straw incorporation and fertilizer addition in the long term, due to increased soil aeration and more rapid residue decomposition under AWD.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Site description
A field experiment was conducted at the Africa Rice Center's Regional Sahel Station at Ndiaye in the Senegal River delta (16o11'N, 16o15'W). Trials were conducted in both the dry and wet season, spanning the 2007-2009 wet seasons. Climate data were collected 300 m from the experiment in a cropped rice field (Fig. 1). Ndiaye's soil is an Orhithionic Gleysol (FAO, 2006), and is comprised of oceanic sediments overlain by alluvial deposits. Texture (0-20 cm) is 16-44-40% sand, silt and clay (Haefele, 2001). Although subsoil materials of marine origin can cause serious soil salinity problems in the region (Ceuppens et al., 1997), initial electrical conductivity was low. Soil properties before the experiment were 0.87 g total N kg-1 and 9.6 g total C kg-1 (analysis with a Vario Max Dry Combustion Analyzer, Elementar Americas, Mt. Laurel, NJ following the IOS (1998)), 5.81 kg P-Olsen kg-1 (measured following extraction in 0.5 M NaHCO3 at pH 8.5 (Olsen et al., 1954)), 0.47 cmol exchangeable K kg-1 (atomic absorption spectroscopy after extraction in 1 M NH4OAc at pH 7), pH of 4.76 (1:2.5 H20 saturated paste) and EC 0.33 dS m-1 (1:5 H20 saturated paste).
2.2. Experimental design and establishment
A split-plot experiment with four replicates was established. Main plots were crop management systems, RMP and SRI (Table 1). Sub-plots measured 25 m2, and consisted of four randomized treatments:
1. A no straw or mineral fertilizer additions control treatment (-ST-F). 2. A straw-only control treatment with 5 t ha-1 (dry weight) rice straw incorporated before transplanting, but without mineral fertilizer (+ST-F). 3. Mineral fertilizer only (-St+F). 4. Rice straw incorporation at the same rate and timing as the straw
only control followed by mineral fertilizer application (+ST+F).

In plots receiving fertilizer, DAP was applied basally (19.3 and 21.5 kg N and P ha-1), and three urea splits were broadcasted into 1-5 cm of water (101.3 kg N ha-1; 40% at early-tillering, 40% at panicle initiation, and 20% at heading). Fertilizer K is generally not recommended by extension officials because of high soil-K reserves (Haefele et al., 2004), and was therefore excluded. Before the experiment, soils were ploughed and disk-harrowed, after which bunds were constructed to isolate main plots. An additional bund was built to contain sub-plots within main plots, and plastic sheeting was installed over all main and sub-plot bunds to 0.5 m depth to eliminate seepage. A 4 m space was also maintained between main plots to prevent lateral water movement.

In the 2007 wet season, rice straw obtained from a neighboring farm was incorporated (0-15 cm depth) into damp soil with a hoe 15 days before transplanting, after which plots were leveled. In subsequent seasons, straw was incorporated 19-21 days before transplanting. Straw N and C concentrations were determined by combustion (Vario Max N/C Analyzer, Elementar Americas, Mt. Laurel, NJ, Table 2). Phosphorus and potassium were determined following Yoshida et al. (1976) and Walinga et al. (1989). The short-duration O. sativa cultivar Sahel-108 (IR-13240-1082-2-3) was grown during all seasons. Transplanting for both

anagement systems took place on 7 (2007 and 2008 wet season) nd 25 (2009 wet season) August and on 19 March (2008 and 2009 ry season).
.3. Water inflows and water table depths
Water used for seedbeds, land preparation and postransplanting irrigation was quantified by recording the height f water passing through V-notched weirs placed at the inlet of eedbeds and main plots, at 1-min intervals for seedbeds, and -min intervals for main-plots, respectively. After passage through he weir, water was equally distributed to sub-plots. Irrigation was alculated as:
= 13.8 tan
( ) H2.5 (1)
here Q is water discharged (l min-1), is the angle of the weir, and is the water head level (cm) measured before passing through the -notch (USBR, 2001). Q was combined with precipitation and conerted to m3 of water ha-1 applied for the entire season. Field water eight within sub-plots was measured daily in open-ended, perfoated PVC tubes (30 cm diameter). Ground water depths (0-1.5 m) utside experimental plots were similarly monitored with 12 PVC ubes (6 cm diameter), each placed 4 m from main plots. Percolaion in RMP sub-plots was measured in 60 cm long closed tubes (30 iameter) placed into the subsoil until 45 cm depth. Drainage volme was calculated as the difference in standing field water height mmediately before and after drainage events, multiplied by plot urface area.
.4. Chemical composition of irrigation, flood and rainwater
When a floodwater layer was present, EC was measured at least wice weekly with a portable meter. Water mineral N concenrations were determined during irrigation from a sample taken mmediately before V-notched weirs. Samples were placed on ice, eturned to the lab and filtered through Whatman No. 42 paper. H4 + and NO3 - concentrations were subsequently measured with n auto-analyzer (Seal Analytical, Mequon, WI) following Andersen nd Ingram (1989). Precipitation and floodwater samples, the later collected immediately before drainage events, were analyzed n the same way. Mean irrigation, flood and rainwater mineral N oncentrations were 1.3, 1.7 and 3.6 mg l-1, respectively. Based n previous studies on the same experimental site (Faye, 1996; aefele, 2001; Samba Diene, 1998), P and K concentrations in irrigaion and floodwater were estimated at 0.1 mg P l-1 and 3.2 mg K l-1. verage rainwater P and K concentrations were derived from hornton (1965) and Peri (1985) as 0.03 mg P l-1 and 1.0 mg K l-1.
.5. Soil and plant sampling
Prior to the onset and at the very end of the five-season experment (hence before straw incorporation in the 2007 wet season, nd at harvest of the 2009 wet season), five soil cores (0-15 cm epth) were taken from each plot to assess total N and C, P-Olsen, xchangeable K, pH and EC. Additional cores were retrieved at 0, 0, 30 and 35 days after transplanting, booting, flowering, and harests in all seasons to determine volumetric water content. Yield corrected to 14% moisture content) was measured at physiologial maturity from 6.25 m2 in each sub-plot. Straw yield, sampled rom the same area, was measured fresh and corrected for moisure content using a 300 g oven dried sub-sample. Six additional ills of rice were sampled to determine grain and straw nutrient oncentrations as described above.

Water productivity of irrigation and rainwater (WP, kg grain m-3 water) was calculated for main-effects as:
Y
I + P (2)
where Y is grain yield (kg ha-1), I is irrigation and P is precipitation (m3) summed for seedbeds, land preparation and the post-transplanting period. The recovery of N derived from incorporated rice straw without fertilizer application was calculated as:
N+ST-F-N-ST-F
STN (3)
where N+ST-F is N in rice biomass (grain N + straw N) ha-1 in the straw-only sub-treatment, N-ST-F is rice biomass N ha-1 in the no straw or fertilizer additions sub-treatment, and STN is kg N ha-1 applied in incorporated rice straw. Conversely, the recovery of N derived from straw when incorporated with fertilizer was calculated as:
N+ST+F-N-ST+F
STN (4)
where N+ST+F is rice biomass N ha-1 in the straw and fertilizer amended sub-treatment and N-ST+F is rice biomass N ha-1 in subtreatments receiving fertilizer only. The recovery of fertilizer N when applied without straw incorporation was next quantified as:
N-ST+F-N-ST-F
FN (5)
with FN being kg fertilizer N applied ha-1. Finally, the recovery of fertilizer N when applied following straw incorporation was calculated as:
N+ST+F-N+ST-F
FN (6)
Partial N-P-K balances over five seasons were estimated as the summed total of N-P-K inputs from mineral fertilizers, straw application, wet deposition and irrigation, minus the sum of N-P-K exports in harvested grain and straw, and in drainage water.

Data for each season were checked for homoscedasticity and normality following Sokal and Rohlf (1995), and analyzed using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS Institute Inc., San Francisco). Yield, nutrient uptake and recovery, water productivity, and soil quality data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant results for separate tests of fertilizer and straw application followed by non-significant interactions indicate additive effects, whereas significant interactions indicate either negative or synergistic effects. When additive or synergistic effects were observed, main management system effects were analyzed.
3. Results
3.1. Grain yield
In the first three experimental seasons, the only significant yield effect was in response to fertilizer application (P < 0.001 for seasons 1-3), which increased yields by an average of 1.7 (2007 wet season), 3.4 (2008 dry season) and 2.6 t ha-1 (2008 wet season) across management systems (Fig. 2). No seasonal differences in yield were observed. In the 2009 dry season, significant management system x fertilizer (P < 0.05) and management system x fertilizer x straw interactions were observed (P < 0.05). Fertilizer application in SRI increased yield by 3.3 and 3.8 t ha-1 when applied alone and in combination with straw, respectively, relative to 3.1 and 2.2 t ha-1 in RMP. The three-way management system x fertilizer x straw interaction was caused by low SRI

ST+F yield, while yield under the same RMP sub-treatment was 0% less than SRI. Both straw and fertilizer application had sigificant yield effects (P < 0.001), though their interaction remained on-significant, indicating additive benefits from their combinaion under both management systems, starting four seasons after traw incorporation began.

In the fifth and final season, a significant system x straw incororation effect (P < 0.001) resulted from higher yields in the +ST-F ub-treatment (4.1 t ha-1) and lower +ST+F yields (6.9 t ha-1) under MP relative to SRI (3.8 and 7.3 t ha-1 for the same treatments). n contrast to previous seasons where only fertilizer significantly ncreased yields, when SRI alone was subject to an ANOVA, -ST-F, ST-F, -ST+F and +ST+F yields were all significantly different P < 0.05), and increased with N application from straw and ferilizers (Fig. 2). In contrast, yields under RMP reverted to a similar attern as the first three seasons, with significant increases only n response to fertilizer (P < 0.001). RMP -ST+F yields were also ignificantly different (P < 0.05) and 22% greater than the correponding SRI sub-treatment. However, no yield differences were ound between management systems when comparing the +ST+F ub-treatment. While a significant additive effect (P < 0.001) of ombined fertilizer and straw application was observed, it occurred nly for SRI. Significant differences between management systems ere also recorded in the last season (P = 0.014), with RMP yieldng slightly more (+0.3 t ha-1) than SRI when averaged across all ub-treatments.
.2. Water management and water productivity
Water inflows to SRI were always significantly less than under MP (P < 0.001 for all seasons). Savings tended to be greater in the ry season, when evaporative demand was higher. The total seaonal volume of irrigation and precipitation used in RMP ranged rom 7537 to 15,632 m3 ha-1 compared to 6345-10,055 m3 ha-1 in RI across seasons (Table 3).

In RMP, field water levels were consistently above the soil surace, with the exception of the first few days after transplanting
hen plots were left moist but not flooded to facilitate seedling
stablishment, and when drainage was performed for herbicide pplication (Fig. 3). Conversely, there was no floodwater in SRI for 2, 52, 53, 54 and 26% of the days in each season from the 2007

wet season to the 2009 dry season. The 2009 wet season had the lowest number of completely non-flooded days because a series of heavy rainfall events raised water levels in exit canals, thereby inhibiting effective drainage. Percolation in RMP was consistently less than 2.2 mm day-1 in RMP, regardless of seasons (data not shown). In general, below-surface field water depths did not exceed -12 cm under SRI, whereas the maximum above surface floodwater measurement was 6 cm. Soil volumetric water content under SRI remained generally higher than 30%, even during non-flooded periods.

Reduced irrigation volume under SRI resulted in consistently and significantly higher WP compared to RMP, ranging from 11% to 45% across seasons (Table 4). No significant correlations between yield and water use were found for either crop management system, and floodwater EC remained consistently below 0.9 dS m-1 across seasons, regardless of treatment (data not shown).
3.3. Nutrient dynamics
3.3.1. Nutrient uptake from straw and fertilizer Fertilizer application alone had a significant positive effect on crop N, P and K uptake in total biomass measured at harvest during the first three experimental seasons (P < 0.001 for each season). In the 2009 dry season, no difference between management systems in uptake of any macronutrient was found. Both fertilizer and straw application significantly increased N, P and K uptake in SRI and RMP during this season (Fig. 4). The occurrence of a significant fertilizer x straw interaction (P < 0.05) for N uptake also indicated synergistic effects resulting from the combination of fertilizer and straw application under both management systems. Conversely, P and K uptake effects remained additive. In the subsequent 2009 wet season, N uptake in grain and straw, averaged across subtreatments, was significantly less in SRI than in RMP (P < 0.01). Significantly (P < 0.05) less fertilizer N (25 kg ha-1) was taken up in the -ST+F treatment in the former as opposed to latter management system (Fig. 4). In contrast, the combination of fertilizer and straw application resulted in similar N uptake for both management systems. Fertilizer application had significant yield effects in RMP, while straw incorporation did not show any significant effect. Conversely, both fertilizer and straw incorporation were significant under SRI, while their interaction was not. Additive effects therefore occurred under SRI only (Fig. 4). The same additive trend was T.J. K Rupnik et al. / Field Crops R Esearch 130 (2012) 155-167

.3.2. Straw N recovery Regardless of management system, no significant differences
ere observed between straw N recovery at harvest in either
nagement Practices (RMP) and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) at Ndiaye,
+ST-F or +ST+F sub-treatments, until the 2009 dry season (data not shown). In this season, both SRI and RMP captured significantly (P < 0.01) more N from applied straw under +ST+F than in +ST-F. Under these circumstances, the recovery of straw N exceeded 0.9 kg N kg N-1 for both management systems. This pattern shifted in the 2009 wet season, during which a significant management system x straw interaction (P < 0.01) and significant main effects (P < 0.01) were caused by a very high recovery of straw N at harvest

systems or sub-treatments were observed in this or the following two seasons. In the fourth season, straw incorporation followed by fertilizer application increased the recovery of fertilizer N to 0.43 kg N kg N-1 across management systems. Fertilizer N recovery was also significantly (P < 0.01) higher in SRI compared to RMP (a difference of 0.09 kg N kg N-1), driven by increased recovery in both -ST+F and +ST+F sub-treatments. In the fifth season, a significant management system x fertilizer interaction was observed (P < 0.05), with the recovery of fertilizer N in +ST+F plots reaching 0.64 kg N kg N-1 compared to 0.46 kg N kg N-1 in the -ST+F

.4. Partial nutrient balances and soil quality after five cropping easons
.4.1. Partial nutrient balances No significant main effects were found on partial macronutrint balances after five seasons of consecutive cropping. However, hen no fertilizer or straw was applied, highly negative balances ere found under both management systems for N, P and K (Fig. 5). n comparison, straw and fertilizer application each resulted in ignificant and positive N balances measured across management ystems (P < 0.001). Straw application had no effect on P balnces, while fertilizer addition had a small but significant impact P < 0.001), moving P balances towards the positive in RMP and SRI.
ith the exception of the +ST-F sub-treatment, K balances were onsistently negative, irrespective of management system. Relative o controls, highly significant differences were found for K under oth -ST+F and +F+ST sub-treatments (P < 0.001). Under both mangement systems, the negative balance was less severe under the atter treatment (+F+ST). Because SRI used less water during each eason (Table 3), RMP received on average more nutrients via irriation water than SRI over five seasons (72 vs. 46 kg N ha-1, 5 vs.
kg P ha-1 and 167 vs. 114 kg K ha-1). Precipitation imported an stimated 27 kg N, 0.08 kg P and 8 kg K ha-1 to both RMP and SRI lots over the course of five seasons (Fig. 5).
.4.2. Soil quality parameters No significant effects of crop management system, crop
anagement system x fertilizer application, crop manageent system x straw application, nor crop management ystem x fertilizer x straw application were found on soil total N r C, P-Olsen or exchangeable K after five seasons of continuous ropping (Table 6). But when measured across crop management ystems, straw incorporation significantly (P < 0.05) increased total
(with 17%), total C (with 15%) and exchangeable K (with 11%) ompared to non-fertilized (no fertilizer no straw) plots, respecively. Fertilizer application had a near-significant impact on vailable P (P = 0.054), increasing P-Olsen by 21% to 6.9 mg P kg-1. here were no significant differences in soil pH (range 4.7-6.7)
or EC (range 0.40-1.70 dS m-1) between management systems or sub-treatments, although when compared to baseline data taken in 2007 and measured across all plots, the final values for both pH and EC increased by 16% and 215% to means of 5.51 and 1.02 dS m-1 for both parameters (P < 0.001, data not shown).
4. Discussion
4.1. Yield, water savings and water productivity
Water savings ranging from 16%-48% were obtained under SRI in this study, resulting in increased water productivity compared to RMP. In only two of 20 observed cases SRI yields were significantly lower than in comparable RMP sub-treatments (under -ST-F and -ST+F in the 2009 wet season). But while SRI increased water savings and water productivity, no sustained yield or nutrient recovery advantages were found in comparison to any RMP sub-treatment.

Our results therefore indicate that while there is potential for water saving, farmers in the study region are unlikely to realize yield advantages with SRI compared to other improved crop management options when nutrient additions are held constant. This confirms McDonald et al. (2006, 2008), who suggested that SRI's yield benefits were likely to be limited when compared to an appropriate, upper-bound control system. Our results contrast with reports of high-yielding SRI performance in the Sahel where the SRI was compared to lower-bound farmers' practice controls alone, and with highly unequal nutrient additions (e.g. Styger et Al., 2010). Nonetheless, should farmers choose to experiment SRI to save water, our results show that they would be more likely to benefit over the long-term from combined organic matter (straw) and fertilizer application compared to mineral nutrient additions alone.

Reports of increased water productivity with SRI are common in field station experiments (e.g. Zhao Et Al., 2009). But under on-farm conditions, poor land leveling may increase the risk of submergence and plant loss in field depressions where farmers transplant only single, young seedlings and attempt to practice AWD (Krupnik et al., 2012). Similarly, higher field positions may not receive sufficient water and experience increased weed infestation (Rodenburg and Johnson, 2009). Caution should therefore be employed when extrapolating the results of this and other on-station studies to on-farm situations.

RMP) and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) under four fertility treatments ertilizer) in Ndiaye, Senegal. Because plots were rarely drained, drainage values fo ess than 5 kg ha-1 in total.

Ground water depths during the cropping season were generally etween -30 and -70 cm. SRI field water depths never exceeded 12 cm, above the maximum 15 cm depth for ``safe'' AWD with inimal risk of yield loss (Bouman et al., 2007). No correlations
etween water use and yield were observed, indicating that the oot zone in SRI plots was usually either moist or saturated, and hat drought stress was not encountered. Indeed, volumetric water ontent of soils under SRI was generally higher than 30% (data not hown), well above the permanent wilting point of 25% established or this soil by de Vries et al. (2010).

In landscapes with relatively shallow water tables, for examle in riverside depressions as in this study, or in large irrigation chemes with shallow water tables, Belder et al. (2004, 2005) sugested that water savings between 10% and 30% should be possible sing AWD with little yield penalty because rice roots can access ufficient soil moisture from capillary rise. Water-saving potential s also high on finely textured soils (Belder et al., 2007), such as hose in the current study site. Where soils are coarser, or fields re located in more isolated or higher-elevation irrigation schemes, aving water without reducing yield can be more difficult (Tabbal t al., 2002). In the 2009 dry season, very high water savings (48%) ere observed under SRI without significant yield loss compared to MP. Tuong et al. (1994) showed that small-plot experiments with ow bund to surface area ratios can result in unreasonably high eepage rates and exaggeration of estimated water requirements n flooded treatments. Though the bund to area ratio of sub-plots in his experiment was relatively small (0.7 m m-2), we maintain that

water savings are unlikely to have been overestimated because: (i) seepage was minimized by lining bunds with plastic sheeting and installing them into the soil below the plough layer, (ii) bund over-flow was never observed, and (iii) percolation in RMP was low. Also, (iv) evaporative losses are generally higher from ponded water compared to soil surfaces (Belder et al., 2005), and field water levels in SRI were below the surface for 54% of the time for this season. Thus, the water savings observed likely resulted from reduced seepage, careful irrigation in SRI, and higher evaporative floodwater losses from RMP.

The build-up of alkaline salts could also constrain yield in watersaving management systems in the Sahel (de Vries et al., 2010). In this experiment, soil EC increased dramatically after five seasons, confirming previous observations of the impact of double-cropping at the same site (Haefele et al., 2004). However, EC remained well below the threshold of 2.0 dS m-1 after which yield might be affected (Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000), and no differences were found between management systems. But because saline deposits are heterogeneously distributed (Ceuppens et al., 1997), further and longer-term research on the potential interaction between AWD irrigation and salinity should be undertaken.

Despite the water productivity advantages of SRI demonstrated in this study, it must be recognized that SRI is by no means the only method to save water without compromising yield. Evidence of good water savings in conventional management systems where AWD alone is implemented, but where crop establishment, weed and nutrient management remain relatively unchanged compared

Sanjeewanie nd Ranamukharrachchi (2009) contrasted SRI with direct seeding sing AWD in Thailand. Both yield and water productivity were ighest with the latter system. Clearly, further research is needed to racket SRI's performance compared to other management options hat reduce water use.
.2. Recovery of straw and fertilizer nitrogen
Despite the potential for immobilization of fertilizer N when traw residues are incorporated, no negative effects on N uptake ere observed for either system during seasons 1-3 of this experment. In the fourth season, additive N-P-K uptake effects were ound for both crop management systems, but in the fifth and final eason, they were recorded only for SRI. It is not uncommon for sevral seasons to pass before straw incorporation positively affects ield in irrigated rice (Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2005). Delays may esult from the gradual build-up of soil nutrient pools with the susained addition of residues (e.g. Eagle et al., 2000), although when ompared to higher and more balanced mineral N-P-K rates, yield ncreases due to combined organic matter and fertilizer applicaions may not be significant (Dawe et al., 2003). In contrast, the ST+F sub-treatment affected macronutrient uptake more posiively with SRI than RMP in the current study. This suggests that esource-poor farmers unable to afford balanced N-P-K fertilizers ho experiment with SRI could gain from this fertility management trategy, although beneficial effects may only occur after several easons.

The additive SRI yield effects resulting from combined fertilizer nd straw application in the last two seasons of this study can be artially explained by improved recovery both of straw and fertilzer N. In the fourth season, straw N recovery was higher under ST+F compared to +ST-F (a difference of 17 kg ha-1 under SRI nd 7 kg ha-1 under RMP). SRI advocates argue that combined with WD, mechanical weeding aerates the soil and increases N minralization and supply to the crop (Ceesay, 2010; Uphoff et al., 010). However, the improved N uptake and recovery observed n this experiment is unlikely to have been caused by increased oil aeration. Despite the AWD regime, the soil water-status in SRI emained close to saturation. Moreover, volumetric water contents fter weeding tended to be higher than before, because irrigation ad to be introduced to facilitate the movement of rotary weeders. onversely, mechanical weeding may have stimulated mineralizaion by tearing straw into smaller pieces and increasing residue urface area exposed to microbial attack, though additional work is equired to confirm this hypothesis. The recovery of straw N in the ST+F sub-treatment was above 100% in the 2009 wet season, indiating that part of the recovered N was obtained from the labile oil N pool, which was probably augmented through the gradual ecycling of straw N incorporated over the previous four seasons. owever, while improved fertilizer N recovery under SRI has been eported elsewhere (Zhao et al., 2009), it was never statistically uperior to RMP in the current experiment.
.3. Long-term impact on macronutrient balances and soil quality
Both fertilizer and straw inputs, and grain and straw exports, xerted the largest effect on post-experiment partial macronutrient alances in this study. Fertilizer and straw application each posiively affected N balances. Rice straw contains little P, so P balances ere mainly increased by fertilizer alone. And although no fertilzer K was applied, both fertilizer and straw significantly impacted balances. Fertilizer N and P moved K balances towards the negaive because of increased crop growth and uptake of indigenous soil , although in all treatments soil exchangeable K remained above
earch 130 (2012) 155-167 165
the medium K status threshold of 0.45 cmol kg-1, below which fertilizer K might affect yield (Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000). Moreover, no treatment effects on grain or straw K concentrations were observed at harvest in the last season, and levels of each remained above deficiency thresholds according to Dobermann and Fairhurst (2000). But because straw contains large amounts of K, incorporation in +ST-F and +ST+F treatments helped to offset declining partial K balances.

While KCl fertilizer is recommended for double-cropping (Bado et al., 2010), high costs prohibit its use in the Sahel. Haefele et al. (2004) suggested that fertilizer K may not be necessary because equilibrium reactions between exchangeable and high total K reserves in West Africa's river floodplain soils could maintain levels above the critical limit for decades. While this is advantageous for resource-poor farmers unable to afford fertilizer K, we suggest that straw incorporation in double-cropped systems will help to offset losses, thereby prolonging depletion over longer periods of time, thus improving the long-term sustainability of rice cropping. Further research should be conducted to determine if recommended KCl application rates could be reduced where farmers incorporate rice straw, as reduced fertilizer K requirements would make KCl application more affordable, while also helping to maintain soil quality. Future studies should also examine in situ recycling of straw, as opposed to biomass importation as used in the current study. Finally, when measured at the conclusion of the experiment, straw incorporation led to small yet significant increases in total soil C and N compared to controls, arguably improving soil quality in each crop management system. Straw incorporation also supplies micronutrients (Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2005), which we were unable to examine in this study, potentially providing additional agronomic benefits.

Post-experiment estimates of partial macronutrient balances suggested slightly more positive trends for RMP compared to SRI, in part because of greater nutrient inputs through irrigation, although differences were never significant. But in water-saving systems more reliant on drainage, or where less irrigation is needed, differences could be larger. We estimated P and K concentrations in irrigation, rain and floodwater based on previous studies at the same location. Balances may therefore be slightly less accurate than desirable, although significant error is unlikely because concentrations fell within the bounds of the ranges reported in the literature (see Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000). Conversely, gaseous N losses, biological N fixation, leaching, inter-season capillary rise, and dry deposition also play a role in nutrient cycling (Cassman et al., 1998; Haefele, 2001), though we were unable to account for them in this study. Nutrient losses via leaching, however, are unlikely to be large in lowland rice fields (Cassman et al., 1998), especially where soils are finely textured and where water tables remain close to the soil surface. This study therefore provides a first-step towards estimating irrigation, wet deposition, and flood water drainage import and export pathways that are typically not included in partial nutrient balance studies. Additional work is needed to quantify the gaps described above, especially in double-cropped, water-saving rice systems, where import and export pathways could significantly differ.
5. Conclusion
We investigated the potential for water savings and the impact of organic (straw) and inorganic soil fertility amendments on yields and nutrient balances under Recommended Management Practices and the System of Rice Intensification over five seasons in the Senegal River Delta. Our results indicate that substantial water savings and increases in water productivity can be obtained with SRI, although significant yield increases compared to RMP should

ot be expected. Positive effects resulting from straw incorporation ollowed by fertilizer application became apparent in the fourth eason as significant additive increases in yield, straw and fertilizer
recovery were observed under both RMP and SRI. However, coninuation of these trends was only observed for SRI in the fifth and nal season of the experiment, suggesting that integrated organic nd mineral nutrient management of soil fertility is more advanageous with SRI than RMP. Fertilizer and straw additions also had
positive effect on partial macronutrient balances and soil qualty parameters. Further work should be conducted to investigate he mechanisms underlying these results, and to compare SRI's ield and water productivity performance to other water-saving ice management systems. If farmers in the Sahel practicing doubleropping choose to experiment with techniques like SRI to reduce ater use and thus input costs, our findings indicate that they are ost likely to benefit over time by practicing straw residue incororation followed by mineral fertilizer additions, although when utrient additions are held equal, SRI is unlikely to improve yield rends over long-established Recommended Management Pracices.

Life Cycle Thinking for the environmental and financial assessment of rice management systems in the Senegal River Valley .

Rice is a staple food in Senegal, which however imports more than 70% of the rice consumed annually to meet its domestic demand. Despite governmental efforts to increase rice self-sufficiency, both rice supply and yields remain low. Senegalese farmers face challenges related to irrigation infrastructure and fertiliser access, besides those derived from climate change. This study applies Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) combined with financial Life Cycle Costing (LCC) to evaluate alternative scenarios for rice management in the Senegal River Valley and identify sustainability hotspots and potential improvements. Specifically, rice cultivation in Ross Bethio (Saint Louis, Senegal) is assessed based on the observed agricultural practices during the dry seasons of 2016 and 2017. Two scenarios capturing conventional (CONV) and intensive (INT) practices are compared to two reference scenarios (SAED scenarios) according to the recommendations of the official agricultural advisory service. The INT scenario generates the lowest impacts per kg of paddy rice in seven out of thirteen impact categories, including climate change, freshwater and marine eutrophication, ozone depletion and water scarcity. This is due to the higher yields (7.4 t ha 1) relative to CONV (4.8 t ha 1) and the two reference SAED scenarios (6.0 t ha 1). The two latter scenarios show the lowest values in the remaining categories, although they also generate slightly lower profits than INT (138 euro t 1 vs. 149 euro t 1) due to increased labour costs for additional fertilisation treatments. The results from both LCA and LCC underline the importance of increasing yields to decrease environmental impacts and production costs of rice when estimated per kg of product. Well-designed fertiliser application doses and timing and increased mechanisation can deliver further environmental benefits. Additional improvements (e.g. in irrigation, crop rotations, straw management) could be considered to promote the longterm sustainability and profitability of rice production in Senegal. LCA in combination with financial LCC is identified as a decision-support tool for evaluating the sustainability of alternative crop management practices.

1. Introduction .

Rice is a staple food in Africa, where around 40% of total rice consumption is imported, making population more vulnerable to price volatility and supply shortages (Seck et al., 2010). Sub-Saharan African
countries are particularly import-dependent as rice consumption outpaces domestic supply despite progressive increases in rice harvested areas and yields (Diagne et al., 2013; Nasrin et al., 2015). West Africa is the region where the fastest growth in rice demand is projected, i.e. by 13% in 2027 (OECD-FAO, 2018; USDA, 2017). Innovation, policy

support and capacity building are increasingly demanded to boost domestic rice supply and ensure both food availability and access across Sub-Saharan Africa (Africa Rice Center, 2011; Nhamo et al., 2014; Nwilene et al., 2008). However, a shift towards more integrated rice management is needed to contribute to a broader food security concept, increasing crop yields and agricultural sustainability (West et al., 2014). Promoting a sustainable food security challenges both governments and the research community to think beyond increasing food supply (Grote, 2014; Ingram, 2011). Thus, improving rice productivity and sustainability becomes strategic for African countries to meet their 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as it can simultaneously reduce poverty and hunger (SDG1 and SDG2), while promoting growth and employment (SDG8) and more sustainable production and consumption (SDG12).

Senegal is the third-largest rice importer in Africa after Nigeria and South Africa (FAOSTAT, 2021). Rice consumption represents around 31% of the calorie intake in Senegal, though domestic rice production only covers about 28% of the country's requirements, challenging food security (Diagne et al., 2013; FAO, 2010; Puma et al., 2015). The Senegalese government has been launching several strategies to stimulate domestic production, such as the national programme for rice self-sufficiency (PNAR). This was intended to increase total rice supply up to one million tonnes by 2012, by promoting the expansion of cultivated areas, investment in mechanisation and processing technologies, and the professionalisation of supply chain actors (MAER, 2021). The overall goal was not achieved, with around 470,000 tonnes produced in that very year (FAOSTAT, 2021). The second PNAR established new agricultural policies for the period 2014-2017, increasing rice production by more than twofold relative to 2012, i.e. at 1,011,269 tonnes by the end of the period (FAOSTAT, 2021). Average yields however decreased from 4.1 t ha- 1 to 3.3 t ha- 1 in that period, and have remained highly variable, though still higher than those in other Western African countries (FAOSTAT, 2021). Climate change is expected to negatively impact rice productivity in West Africa through droughts and higher temperatures (Van Oort and Zwart, 2018; Wassmann et al., 2009). Further institutional measures that promote technological innovation and more sustainable agricultural practices are needed to counteract these effects and secure rice availability in Senegal (Diagne et al., 2013; Krupnik et al., 2012).

The Senegal River Valley (SRV), located in the Sahel zone, is one of the major irrigated rice-producing areas in Senegal and the whole Africa (Van Oort and Zwart, 2018). In Senegal, rice is also produced in the Southern region of Casamance, although only the SRV diverts part of its rice production to other regional markets (USDA-GAIN, 2018). The favourable climate conditions and the adoption of varieties with shorter cropping cycles allow for two rice harvests per year, namely in the dry and rainy seasons (Van Oort et al., 2016). In the SRV, production areas are typically larger in the dry season, which brings fewer problems with pests and birds (Tanaka et al., 2015; USDA-GAIN, 2018). Average yields in SRV theoretically range between 5.0 and 6.0 t ha- 1 in the rainy season and between 6.5 and 7.5 t ha- 1 in the dry season (SAED, 2019; USDA-GAIN, 2021). Irrigated rice cultivation is particularly intensive in the use of water, posing technological challenges and ecological problems in regions vulnerable to climate change, in addition to financial burdens for small-scale and resource-poor farmers (Diagne et al., 2013; Krupnik et al., 2012; Venema and Schiller, 1995). Investment in more efficient irrigation systems is desirable to help mitigate the risks of drought and ensure a stable rice supply and associated revenues throughout the year (Paglietti and Machado-Mendes, 2016). Farmers face additional hurdles such as breakdown of fertiliser supply or lack of machinery; hence, inputs are often not conveniently applied regarding dates and doses (Diagne et al., 2013). Optimising agricultural practices by taking all these aspects into account is of paramount importance to improve the sustainability of rice cultivation in the SRV under resource constraints.

Rice production is a resource- and emission-intensive activity,
causing environmental impacts both at regional and global scales, such as water depletion, land occupation, or global warming (Sporchia et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). Rice production is responsible for approximately 11% of the global anthropogenic CH4 emissions, the most significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions among food crops (Jiang et al., 2019). Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) has been proposed as a multi-dimensional framework to reduce impacts from production and consumption from a supply chain perspective, that is, by considering all processes from raw materials extraction to disposal (Guinee et al., 2011; Sonnemann et al., 2018). As for the environmental dimension, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) applies LCT to quantify several impacts in terms of ecosystems damage, resource depletion, and human health. Life Cycle Costing (LCC) assesses the economic performance of production systems, often as costs and profits, and can be applied in combination with LCA to quantify impact abatement costs of alternative production technologies or decisions (Escobar et al., 2015; Fenollosa et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2009). Financial LCC considers all the activities that represent either direct costs to the decision-maker or make them a profit during the economic life of the investment, i.e. all the costs of fulfilling the functional unit (FU), including production, operation and disposal (Carlsson Reich, 2005; Lichtenvort et al., 2008). While the costs of environmental externalities could also be estimated, this requires the application of additional methodologies or principles. In general, only those costs that are likely to be covered by actors in the product system and within the decision-relevant timeframe should be monetised (Swarr et al., 2011). The application of LCA and financial LCC provides valuable information on the sustainability trade-offs of alternative scenarios. Yet, the number of studies that combine LCC with LCA to evaluate rice production systems is relatively limited (Arunrat et al., 2016; Jirapornvaree et al., 2021; Saber et al., 2020; Thanawong et al., 2014).

Many LCA studies focus on the environmental performance of rice cultivation, considering alternative crop management options (Bacenetti et al., 2016; Fusi et al., 2014; Harun et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2020). Nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from fertilisers application are a major contributor to eutrophication and acidification impacts associated with rice production; while also being a cause of climate change together with CH4 emissions from flooded fields (Bacenetti et al., 2016; Hayashi et al., 2016; Thanawong et al., 2014). Hence, improving fertiliser management is crucial to simultaneously decrease impacts of climate change, acidification and freshwater eutrophication (Wang et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2013, 2020). Water scarcity impacts of rice have been less sistematically examined, as a broader consensus on the characterisation methods to be applied has only recently been reached (Boulay et al., 2018; Jolliet et al., 2018; Nunez et al., 2016). Similarly, ecosystems and human toxicity impacts have been frequently neglected in LCAs of agricultural products due to the lack of agreement on both the framework for modelling primary emissions from pesticides and characterisation factors for all chemicals involved (Fantke et al., 2018; Pena et al., 2019; Rosenbaum et al., 2015). This underlines the importance of adequately selecting the methods to estimate on-field emissions, especially for reactive N from fertilisers (e.g. NH3 or N2O). LCAs mostly rely on the Tier 1 approach of the IPCC (2006) guidelines, which provide default emission factors (EFs) that do not consider the influence of climate, soil characteristics, type of fertiliser and time of application or the irrigation system (Brodt et al., 2014; Cayuela et al., 2017). Perrin et al. (2014) recommend performing soil N balances combined with mechanistic and dynamic models to develop generic tools for calculating N-related emissions from agri-food production. Although data-intensive, mechanistic models are suitable tools for quantifying on-field emissions when fertiliser application is relevant for the LCA study (Andrade et al., 2021).

Improving the environmental and economic performances of rice production in the SRV is key to increase food self-sufficiency in Senegal, given the contribution of the region to the domestic rice supply. This study aims to evaluate observed and recommended rice cultivation practices in the municipality of Ross Bethio (Saint Louis, Senegal),

located in the SRV, to identify sustainability hotspots and suggest improvements. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first case study that combines LCA and financial LCC for the sustainability assessment of rice production in an African context. This study is the result of a 2-year research project (AD1511-UPV) funded by the Centre for Development Cooperation of the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Spain), carried out jointly with Caritas Spain and Caritas Senegal in 2016-2017. The project's goal was to improve rice production in Ross Bethio by increasing yields and economic profits while decreasing environmental impacts, in order to promote rural development and a sustainable food security in the region.

2. Methods .

2.1. Life cycle assessment .

2.1.1. Goal and scope definition .

The goal of the LCA is to quantify the environmental and economic impacts of rice cultivation in Ross Bethio (Senegal), based on the agricultural practices applied by the Union of Women Rice Producers (UFPRRB, according to the French acronym) during the dry seasons of 2016 and 2017. The observed practices are compared to those reference practices recommended by the Society for the Management and Exploitation of the Senegal River Delta (SAED, according to the French acronym). SAED is a governmental organisation that promotes irrigated agriculture on the left margin of both the Senegal and Faleme rivers.

Ross Bethio is a municipality in the Dagana Department, in the North-Western region of Saint Louis. It is located 47 m above sea level, near the mouth of the Senegal River, where this provides water for rice irrigation. Until recently, the propagation of tidal variations in water level over large distances and the saline water intrusion into the river generated a vast area with weakly drained halomorphic soils (Isupova and Mikhailov, 2008). However, the hydrological regime of the Senegal River mouth area radically changed in 1986 after the Diama dam was built, forming an obstacle to both the upstream flow of seawater and tidal level variations. Despite the good quality of the water, soil salinity became a limiting factor for rice production in the area of study, negatively affecting rice yields.

The Saint Louis region has a tropical climate with an average low temperature above 18 oC throughout the year, which allows for two rice harvests per year. These correspond to the dry season (from February/ March to June/July) and the rainy season (from July to November). The annual reference evapotranspiration is greater than 2500 mm (Ndiaye et al., 2020). Table 1 shows the climatic conditions in Ross Bethio (world weather online, 2021). The most important edaphic characteristics measured in the plots at the beginning of the project (2016) are included in Table 2. The high soil salinity stands out, as well as its variability depending on the location of the plot.

The UFPRRB is responsible for 130 ha in total, handed over by the national government. Women are organised by simple agreement in groups of at least two people (either legal or physical), i.e. the so-called economic interest groups (GIE, according to the French acronym). GIEs do not have the obligation of initial capital and are flexible organisations from the legal point of view, which allows the most modest initiatives to be organised and access credit (Tarriere Diop, 1995). The UFPRRB consists of 28 GIEs and each producer receives 1 ha. Typically, those plots cultivated in the rainy season lay fallow in the next dry season and vice-versa. Specifically, in the dry season of 2016, Caritas funded the cultivation of 30 ha corresponding to seven GIEs; whereas, in 2017, the overall area managed by the NGO was 15 ha. It must be noted that rice production is only assessed in these two successive dry seasons, as the crop failed in the corresponding rainy seasons due to technical problems. In April 2016, the main irrigation canal was completely dry for twelve days, exactly when plants' panicles were at the initiation stage, allowing rodents to invade the plots and suck the sap. As a result, there was hardly any rice production in the rainy season of 2016. In 2017, Caritas Spain's auditors decided to withdraw the project arguing that Ross Bethio had reached an acceptable level of development. The NGO thus reallocated the funds to a one-year project in Podor, Senegal's northernmost town, on the border with Mauritania.

The primary goal of rice production in Ross Bethio is to provide food for both self-consumption and for other regional markets, contributing to food availability (see section 1). Therefore, the FU is defined under a productive scope as 1 kg of paddy rice (with 20-24% moisture). The system boundaries include all processes involved in rice production from cradle to farm gate, i.e. before drying (Fig. 1). These refer to the following processes: the production of seeds, fertilisers, and herbicides; transport of agricultural inputs to the farms; diesel production for the irrigation pump and agricultural machinery; and on-field emissions from input application. Upstream machinery production is excluded, as machinery operations are outsourced, implying intensive use and low environmental impacts per FU.

2.1.2. Description of scenarios .

Two scenarios are defined describing the actual agricultural practices implemented by UFPRRB farmers, based on surveys conducted in 2016 and 2017 (Table 3). The first scenario is referred to as conventional (CONV) as it reflects the average practices of the GIEs through the period of study (30 ha in 2016; 9 ha in 2017). The second scenario, intensive (INT), corresponds to the more intensive practices applied in 2017 by a group of farmers with 6 ha in total, where both the seed and fertiliser doses were increased. Moreover, two additional ex-ante scenarios according to the recommendations of the official agricultural advisory service of the SRV (SAED, 2009a,b) are taken as reference, namely SAED_2td and SAED_3td, which mainly differ in terms of fertiliser doses and number of top-dressing applications. These two scenarios were not implemented in practice but represent theoretical alternatives that are also feasible for SRV farmers, taking into account the availability of fertilisers in the region and other resource constraints. Table 3 summarises the quantity and type of inputs used in each scenario, agricultural practices, and associated yields. Table 4 shows the underlying

amount of nutrients applied per scenario. Soil preparation is the same in all scenarios. Before sowing, deep tillage is carried out every three years with a mouldboard plough coupled to a tractor. Additionally, two weeks before sowing, a shallow tillage (10-15 cm) is made, with a disc plough followed by land levelling to improve water management and weed control. Furthermore, irrigation channels are manually cleaned and repaired at the beginning of every season.

In all scenarios, seeds of the rice variety Sahel 108 are sown, a shortcycle variety (around 125 days) especially developed by the International Rice Research Institute to succeed under extreme conditions in the African Sahel. The major disadvantage of this variety is that it is not tolerant to salinity. Seeds are pre-germinated by soaking the seed sacks and then burying them in the ground for 24 h. Broadcast seeding is carried out by hand on irrigated plots with a 2-5 cm depth sheet of water. After sowing, fields should be periodically irrigated to hold a sheet of water of 5 cm during the vegetative phase (around 55 days). At the beginning of the reproductive phase, the water table is increased to 10 cm; then, it remains until two weeks after blossom, that is, another 55 days. Although this is the standard practice, the water table was not always maintained at the desired level, which explains the high presence of weeds observed in most plots.

As for weed control, herbicides are applied with a knapsack sprayer. The active ingredients and the corresponding doses are shown in Table 3. Following SAED's recommendations, herbicide treatment in all the scenarios consists first in spreading Bensulfuron-methyl (CAS RN 83055-99-6) on the flooded soil around six days after sowing. Propanil (CAS RN 709-98-8) and 2,4-D (CAS RN 94-75-7) are applied three weeks after sowing, after draining the soil. The plots are irrigated between 48 and 72 h later.

UFPRRB farmers do not perform a basic dressing, arguing that this later leads to more weeds. Hence, only two top dressings are applied in the CONV scenario (see Table 3): the first one with urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP) at the beginning of tillering; and the second only with urea at panicle initiation. In INT, a basic dressing is firstly applied with urea and DAP, followed by two top-dressing applications with urea. SAED_2td and SAED_3td scenarios are similar to CONV in terms of fertiliser doses, but the former use DAP for basic fertilisation and urea for top dressing. The difference between SAED_2td and SAED_3td is that urea is fractionated in two and three applications, respectively.

When rice ripening begins, plots are drained and, two weeks later, rice is harvested. In CONV and INT scenarios, rice is harvested by hand, with the help of an animal-drawn thresher. In this case, a service provider organizes a group of 6-8 workers, who harvest 2 ha per working day. Yields are estimated by each GIE based on the number of sacks obtained by each farmer and their corresponding average weight (80 kg rice per sack). Sacks that are not full are weighed in situ. At the end of the cropping season, the UFPRRB farmers reported average yields for the two seasons assessed of 4832 kg ha- 1 and 7425 kg ha- 1 for the areas under CONV and INT management, respectively. The theoretical yield in the two SAED scenarios is taken from the technical data sheet (SAED, 2009a, b). This is 6000 kg ha- 1 assuming compliance with the input application doses and timing. SAED also recommends the use of a combine harvester for harvesting rice, which can contribute to increased productivity. Since the GIE's farmers have the possibility to outsource the use of this technology, it was considered that the two SAED scenarios employ a combine harvester with an estimated diesel consumption of 12 L ha- 1. While manual harvesting covers 2 ha per day, the combine harvester harvests approximately 5 ha every day, reducing labour costs.

The rice straw is commonly lefton the field to feed free-roaming cattle; therefore, no allocation is made between paddy rice and straw in any scenario, as the latter has no economic value.

2.1.3. Inventory data collection .

In the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) phase, several data sources were used and assumptions were made to collect data on environmentally relevant inputs and outputs from cradle to farm gate, as follows:
Agricultural inputs. Primary data on crop management and agricultural input intensity in scenarios CONV and INT were collected from surveys to UFPRRB farmers and interviews with Caritas' technicians. These data cover all agricultural practices, from soil preparation before sowing to rice harvesting. For the SAED scenarios, agricultural inputs and doses were in line with SAED's recommendations (SAED, 2009a,b), as specified above.

Emissions from fertilisers application. N losses from fertiliser application (as N2O and NH3 emissions to air and NO3
- leached to groundwater) and N emission responses to soil and water management were estimated with LEACHN, the N module of the LEACHM model (Hutson and Wagenet, 1992). This a mechanistic, one-dimensional, and dynamic
method in line with IPCC's Tier 3 approach, which estimates losses of ammonium, urea and nitrate by lixiviation; ammonium losses by volatilisation; and nitrate losses by denitrification. To simulate N dynamics, LEACHN models water and solute movement, as well as related chemical and biological processes in the unsaturated soil. Water and nutrient fluxes are estimated by numerical integration of the Richards' equation and the convection-dispersion equation for solute transport. Both equations can be applied to unsaturated as well as saturated soils (Hutson and Wagenet, 1992). N fluxes among compartments are simulated with first order kinetics for the N dynamics (Hutson and Wagenet, 1991). LEACHN considers three organic pools (manure, litter, and a relatively stable humus fraction) and three mineral pools (urea, ammonium, and nitrate) for N cycling. Thus, LEACHN offers advantages over IPCC's Tier 1 approach, as the former captures the influence of soil and climate conditions, together with water and N fertiliser management, on N-related emissions and the subsequent environmental impacts.

As for data requirements, LEACHN is based on actual data on N inputs through rainwater and irrigation, fertilisation and organic amendments. Nitrification, volatilisation, and denitrification rates specific for flooded rice soils were taken from Chowdary et al. (2004). Additional data on soil, irrigation and crop characteristics were obtained experimentally from one selected plot during the 2017 dry season, corresponding to the CONV scenario. In this plot, soil samples were taken before sowing at 15 cm intervals down to 30 cm (Table 5). The amount of water applied per watering in the plot was estimated by measuring the rise in the water table. Additionally, meteorological data (daily rainfall, maximum and minimum air temperature) for the seasons of study were taken from Accuweather (2017). The meteorological station in Diobene (Thies, Senegal) was considered, as the closest one for which daily data were available. Reference evapotranspiration was estimated from the daily maximum and minimum air temperature using the Hargreaves method (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). The hydraulic parameters of the model were estimated from the SPAW software (Saxton and Rawls, 2006) by using data on soil texture and organic carbon content from the soil analysis (see Table 5). The LEACHN model was calibrated by adjusting water infiltration and drainage according to the meteorological parameters indicated. The calibrated model was then applied to the remaining scenarios by considering the same climatic data and irrigation frequency as in CONV but varying the fertiliser application doses.

In addition to N emissions, CO2 emissions from urea application were calculated under the Tier 1 approach of the IPCC (2006) guidelines. Emissions from phosphorus application, namely phosphate (PO4
3- ) to both groundwater and surface water, were calculated according to Nemecek et al. (2014). Specifically, an average P leaching of 0.07 kg ha- 1 year- 1 and run-off of 0.175 kg ha- 1 year- 1 was taken into account for arable land.

Methane emissions. Anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in flooded rice paddies produces CH4, which is released to the atmosphere primarily by transport through the rice plants (IPCC, 2019). As Tier 2 EFs for CH4 emissions specific for African countries are not available (Boateng et al., 2017), these emissions were estimated under the Tier 1 approach (IPCC, 2006), considering the revised EFs (IPCC, 2019). The following assumptions were taken: the plots are drained before the second herbicide treatment during a period shorter than three days; fields are left in fallow prior to the crop establishment, with a non-flooded pre-season longer than 180 days; and no organic matter is added.

Pesticide emissions. To estimate emissions from herbicides application, the PestLCI Consensus model v1.0 was used (Fantke et al., 2017a, b). This model departs from the original pesticide emission model PestLCI (Birkved and Hauschild, 2006; Dijkman et al., 2012). It has been further developed and parametrised to represent different crop types (including paddy rice), plant growth stages, drift deposition curves, and pesticide application methods.

N. Escobar et al.

Journal of Environmental Management 310 (2022) 114722
The primary distribution of herbicides was modelled for each scenario with the PestLCI web-tool (https://pestlciweb.man.dtu.dk/), covering the initial processes within a few minutes after application. This allowed estimating both on-field and off-field emissions in the three environmental compartments, i.e. air, water and agricultural soil. Offfield herbicide emissions (i.e. drift fraction deposited in off-field surfaces) were further distributed among the environmental compartments using the water-to-soil area ratio for Senegal. A ratio of 0.02 was estimated based on soil and land cover data at the country level (BGS, 2019; Furian et al., 2011).

The emission fractions linked to the use of herbicides are based on the respective contents of active ingredient (a.i.) and the respective application doses indicated by UFPRRB farmers and SAED recommendations. The growth stage of the plants during pesticide application was considered in combination with the BBCH-scale to determine the leaf area index, and hence, the fractions intercepted by the leaves. The BBCH-scale describes the phenological development stage for different plants, including rice. As for data requirements, the web-tool available for the PestLCI Consensus model uses actual data on pesticide treatments, considering the effect of tillage, pesticide application method, presence of buffer zones, and edaphoclimatic characteristics, among other factors.

Irrigation water. Due to lack of records, irrigation water had to be estimated in a representative plot during the dry season of 2017, based on the number of waterings made, their duration, and the pump's flow rate. The average dose of water per season was calculated at 17,600 m3 ha- 1, although it can vary depending on the specific soil characteristics of the plot. The consumptive part of the irrigation water withdrawal was estimated based on the crop evapotranspiration.

Background processes. For the background LCI data, both Ecoinvent 3.6 (Wernet Et Al., 2016) and GaBi databases (Sphera Solutions GmbH, 2021) were used - see table S1 in the electronic supplementary material (ESM). Default processes from Ecoinvent v3.6 were chosen to include energy production, fertiliser and herbicides manufacturing, seed production and transport processes, considering cut-off system modelling. For herbicides production, Acetamide-anilide and Sulfonyl-urea compounds were respectively considered as substitutes for propanil and bensulfuron-methyl, which belong to the same chemical group but are not included in the database. Processes on machinery operations - i. e. tractor, combine harvester and irrigation pump -, were taken from the GaBi database. Emissions from both tractor and combine harvester were calculated by adjusting default processes based on primary data on fuel consumption (L ha- 1) and time (h ha- 1) needed for tillage and harvest operations, respectively.

2.1.4. Impact assessment .

The ReCiPe method (Huijbregts et al., 2016) was chosen for the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) at the midpoint level. The following impact categories were selected for being critical for the environmental assessment of agricultural systems such as rice, which are intensive in the use of fertilisers and other resources including water: climate change (CC), as CO2-eq. for a 100-year time horizon (kg); metal depletion (MD), as Cu-eq. (kg); fossil depletion (FD), as oil-eq. (kg); terrestrial acidification (TA), as SO2-eq. (kg); freshwater eutrophication (FwEU), as P-EQ. (kg), marine eutrophication (meu), as N-EQ. (kg); Ozone depletion (OD), as CFC-11-eq. (kg); and photochemical ozone formation for humans (POF-HH) and ecosystems (POF-Ec), both as NOx-eq (kg). Toxicity
impacts, namely freshwater ecotoxicity (FwEtx), human toxicity - carcinogenic (Htx-C), and human toxicity - non-carcinogenic (Htx-NC), are quantified with the USEtox 2.0 model (Fantke et al., 2017a,b) and expressed as mass-based comparative toxic quantities for ecosystems and human health, i.e. CTUe and CTUh, respectively. These, in turn, represent an estimate of the potentially affected fraction of species and human toxicity cases, respectively, integrated over time and volume, per unit of mass of chemical emitted. Finally, the AWARE 1.2C (Boulay et al., 2018) method is employed to assess the impact of blue water scarcity (WS). Under this approach, high characterisation factors for unspecified water are chosen, yielding User Deprivation Potential (UDP) in m3 world-eq.

2.2. Financial life cycle costing .

Different approaches can be taken to carry our an LCC (Ciroth et al., 2008; Lichtenvort et al., 2008). In the present study, the economic performance is assessed through a financial LCC in which the economic value is strictly determined by the internal costs generated along the life cycle. LCC always implies the perspective of an economic agent that acts as a decision-maker (Norris, 2001). In this case, farmers are the decision-makers, who do not bear the costs of environmental pollution. Hence, further externalities from environmental impacts are not taken into account. This financial LCC consists in quantifying life cycle costs, revenues and profits per FU, from cradle to farm gate, consistent with the LCA system boundaries. Total costs were thus calculated based on the management practices and inputs applied by the UFPRRB farmers (Table 3). Specifically, the costs of rice cultivation arise from soil preparation, sowing, watering, pesticide and fertiliser application, and harvesting. As shown in Table 6, production costs include labour, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds, sacks for the harvested rice, water, and machinery use; while depreciation is excluded as machinery operations are outsourced. The respective data were gathered through the above-mentioned interviews, while prices of inputs were gathered from
N. Escobar et al.

Journal of Environmental Management 310 (2022) 114722
the UFPRRB suppliers. This allowed generating a cost-sheet database reflecting both the management practices and the products and services involved in each case.

As can be seen in Table 6, the watering costs consist of a fixed annual fee plus the costs of diesel consumed by the pump and labour. It should also be noted that outsourcing the combine harvester has the same cost per ha (76.20 euro ha- 1) as harvesting by hand (152 euro day- 1) since, on average, the group of workers harvests 2 ha per day.

Revenues were calculated as the yield multiplied by the average selling price of paddy rice in 2016-2017 as provided by the UFPRRB, i.e. 130 CFA francs per kg. It must be noted that, on average, around 50% of the total paddy rice production is used for self-consumption, according to the surveys among UFPRRB members. Therefore, to calculate the profits, the effect of self-consumption was included as avoided (negative) costs (i.e. by not buying white rice instead), considering that 1 kg of paddy rice yields 0.63 kg of white rice (FAO, 1992). The average retail price of white rice (270 CFA kg- 1) was taken from the Senegalese Office of the Food Security Commissioner (Comissariat a la Securite Alimentaire, 2017). Finally, the profits obtained by the farmer were calculated as the difference between the revenues and total costs. Costs, revenues, and profits are expressed in euro by considering the 2018 average exchange rate (1 euro = 655.9890 CFA).

3. Results .

3.1. On-field emissions .

The calculated on-field agricultural emissions per hectare in each scenario are shown in Table 7. CH4 emissions from anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in flooded paddy fields constitute the largest source of GHG emissions (as CO2-eq.), followed by N2O and CO2 emissions from urea application. All scenarios generate the same amount of CH4 per hectare, as this depends on the management practices (irrigation and straw management), which are the same across scenarios. Due to differences in yields, CH4 emissions per kg of rice are estimated at 2.7 10- 3 kg in CONV, 1.7 10- 3 kg in INT and 1.8 10- 3 kg in the two SAED scenarios. These respectively represent 46%, 41% and 44% of the total on-field GHG emissions per FU. On the contrary, direct CO2 emissions make the smallest contribution to on-field GHG emissions (as CO2-eq.) per FU, i.e. between 3% in the two SAED scenarios and 4.5% in INT. This is mainly due to the higher dose of urea applied in the latter (see Tables 3 and 4), which yields the highest CO2 emissions per hectare among all scenarios (see Table 7). When expressed per kg of rice, CO2 emissions are similar in CONV and INT scenarios, at around 5.0 10- 2 kg each. The lowest values are obtained for SAED_2td and SAED_3td, at around 3.7 10- 2 kg CO2, respectively.

N2O emissions make a significant contribution to total on-field GHG emissions. These are determined by the amount of N supplied per hectare, but also by the number of applications, same as any N-related emissions. N2O emissions per hectare are 26% higher in INT than in CONV mainly due to the effect of the residual mineral N that remained in the soil after the previous crop. Intensive fertilisation often increases the residual N, which causes emissions from N volatilisation in the next cropping season. In int, ca. 10% of the N applied to the previous crop remained in the soil, whereas in the other scenarios all mineral N was previously absorbed by the plants. Indeed, LEACHN estimates that approximately 70% of denitrification and leaching losses in INT take place during the first 15 days after sowing. SAED_2td and SAED_3td deliver 11% and 8% lower N2O emissions than CONV; due to the lower N doses and because top dressing is split into two and three applications, respectively. When expressed per FU, all scenarios generate N2O emissions in similar amounts, i.e. around 2.0 10- 3 kg per kg of paddy rice. This implies 39%, 44%, 42% and 41% of total on-field GHG emissions (as kg CO2-eq.) In int, conv, SAED_2td and SAED_3td scenarios, respectively.

As for the remaining N emissions, INT generates 36% higher NH3
emissions from ammonia volatilisation than CONV, when estimated per hectare. Lower urea application doses translate into 13% lower NH3 emissions in SAED_2td; and 24% lower in SAED_3td, where the same urea dose is split into three applications. As observed for N2O emissions, CONV and INT scenarios generate NH3 emissions in similar amounts per kg of paddy rice (1.2 10- 2 and 1.1 10- 2 kg, respectively), whereas the lowest values are obtained for SAED_2td (8.4 10- 3 kg) and SAED_3td (7.3 10- 3 kg). NO3
- emissions to water per hectare are the highest in INT, followed by the two SAED scenarios and CONV. This is related to the higher leaching rates estimated by LEACHN in INT at the beginning of the cropping season, due to residual NO3
- . In INT, basic dressing also contributes to increased NO3
- losses, as more N is readily available in the soil. When estimated per kg of rice, CONV generates the highest NH3 emissions (8.9 10- 3 kg) and INT the lowest (6.6 10- 3 kg).

PO4 3- emissions to water are the same in all scenarios (0.8 kg ha- 1) (Table 7). This is because the model employed to estimate these emissions (Nemecek et al., 2014) does not take into account the P2O5 dose applied, which is still the same across scenarios in this case study (Table 4). This is, in turn, due to the fact that soluble inorganic forms of P are strongly adsorbed by mineral surfaces or precipitate, making the dose irrelevant. When estimated per Fu, int delivers the lowest value (1.1 10- 4 kg), followed by SAED_2td and SAED_3td (1.4 10- 4 kg) and conv (1.7 10- 4 kg).

All scenarios generate the same amount of pesticide emissions per hectare, as the same treatments were applied per scenario (see Table 3). From primary distribution, pesticide emissions are mainly deposited in the soil. Emissions to air are fixed values subject to the application method, which was a knapsack sprayer in all cases. Hence, airborne emissions are 5% of the applied dose in all scenarios. Pesticide emissions to water represent 20% of the off-field emissions, while the remaining 80% are emissions to soil. The CONV scenario is associated with the highest values for all pesticide emissions per FU, while the lowest are estimated in INT. This is due to yield differences, as the herbicide treatment was the same in all scenarios.

3.2. Environmental impact results .

The CONV scenario generates the greatest environmental impacts per FU across all impact categories, as shown in Table 8. This is mainly due to the lower average yield obtained in the 2016 and 2017 dry seasons, relative to the other three scenarios. The yield in INT is 54% higher than in CONV, which offsets the effect of the higher input intensity (e.g. 38.5% greater N application and 25% greater seeding rate), decreasing the values across impact categories relative to the latter scenario. Theoretical yields estimated in SAED_2td and SAED_3td are 24.2% higher than those in CONV, while the N supply is 12.8% lower, which also explains the lower impact values in the former scenarios. INT causes greater impact reductions - relative to CONV - than both SAED scenarios in CC, FwEU, MEU, OD, POF-Ec, POF-HH and WS, where the effect of yield prevails (see Table 8). On the contrary, SAED_2td and SAED_3td cause greater impact reductions than INT in FD, MD, TA, due to the lower doses of fertilisers applied; and in FwEtx, Htx-C and Htx-NC due to the slightly lower toxicity associated with the production and transport of fertilisers in comparison with INT; while the dose of pesticides applied is the same. Impact reductions with respect to CONV vary from 10.6% in OD in SAED_2td to 32.1% in POF-HH in INT. SAED_3td yields greater environmental impact reductions than SAED_2td in those impact categories where on-field N emissions from fertilisers are relevant due to the positive effect of fractioning the application of topdressing fertiliser.

The analysis of the relative contribution of each emission source to the overall life cycle impacts shows similar patterns in all scenarios, as shown in Fig. 2. It should be noted that Fig. 2 shows total human toxicity (Htx) results as the sum of Htx-C and Htx-NC. On-field emissions from fertilisers make the greatest contribution to CC, FwEU, MEU, OD, and TA. Specifically, on-field emissions account for 98% of OD due to N2O
N. Escobar et al.

Journal of Environmental Management 310 (2022) 114722
emissions; and for more than 80% of MEU and TA, regardless of the scenario, due to NH3, NO3 - and PO4 3- . The contribution of these emissions to FwEU is around 50%, with the largest share observed in the two SAED scenarios, i.e. 56%. On-field emissions are responsible for more than 75% of CC due to CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions, e.g. 76% in INT and 79% in both SAED_2td and SAED_3td.

The production of fertilisers is a significant source of impacts due to the consumption of energy and mineral resources, with the subsequent emissions. This sub-stage accounts for >20% of the impacts of FD, FwEU, FwEtx, Htx-C, and MD across scenarios. This share is consistently larger in INT than in the other scenarios, as the amount of fertilisers applied per FU is greater. As expected, WS is mainly associated with irrigation, causing 81% of the total impact in SAED_2td and SAED_3td, 78% in CONV and 72% in INT. Fertiliser production accounts for between 17% and 25% of the WS in the SAED scenarios and INT, respectively. The diesel consumption for irrigation is the primary source of POF-Ec and POF-HH, causing more than 75% of these across scenarios. Watering is also an important contributor to FD, accounting for more than 30% of it in all scenarios, with the largest share observed in SAED_2td and SAED_3td (40%). Htx-NC is mainly associated with three stages, namely the transport of agricultural inputs, watering and the production of fertilisers. All of them account for between 20% and 36% of the impact, depending on the scenario. The remaining life cycle stages make a relatively small contribution to all impact categories. Given the low level of mechanisation, the use of agricultural machinery represents less than 1% of all impacts across scenarios, including the SAED
scenarios, in which a combine harvester is used.

3.3. Economic results .

As observed in the environmental impact results, the comparative results from the economic assessment are greatly influenced by the yield in each scenario (Fig. 3). The CONV scenario has the lowest yield and is associated with the highest costs per FU, i.e. 0.107 euro kg- 1. On the contrary, the costs are the lowest in INT, at 0.079 euro kg- 1, despite the higher input intensity - both for seeds and fertilisers. Total costs are estimated at 0.090 euro kg- 1 in SAED_2td and SAED_3td, respectively. The only difference between these two is the additional labour needed for the third top dressing in the latter, which plays a minor role in the costs per FU. It should be recalled that the two SAED scenarios employ a combine harvester, which contributes to the higher yields relative to CONV. This also translates into differences in the cost distribution across scenarios. While machinery accounts for around 17% of total costs in the two SAED scenarios, this share is <3% in both CONV and INT. In contrast, labour respectively accounts for around 25% and 23% in CONV and INT, while it represents around 10% of the total costs in the two SAED scenarios. Yet, the fertiliser acquisition accounts for the largest cost share across scenarios, varying between 26% in CONV and 29% in INT. The cost share of watering varies between 21% of the costs in INT and 24% in CONV. Costs of seeds account for around 10-11% of the total costs across scenarios. The acquisition of herbicides represents the smallest shares of the production costs (<5%), followed by the acquisition of

sacks, which account for a maximum of 8% in INT. When considering the average selling price of paddy rice and the retail price of white rice in the period of study (to include the costs avoided by self-consumption - see section 2.2), revenues per FU are estimated at 0.228 euro kg- 1 in all scenarios. It must be borne in mind that straw is not sold, which could otherwise generate different revenues per scenario due to differences in yields. Based on the above, the highest profits are obtained in the INT scenario (0.149 euro kg- 1), followed by the two SAED scenarios (0.138 euro kg- 1); while the lowest profits are estimated for CONV at 0.121 euro kg- 1. Although the costs per hectare of using
combine harvester are the same as those of manual harvesting (50,000 CFA ha- 1), mechanisation increases the cost-efficiency per unit of output, increasing profits per FU.

4. Discussion .

4.1. Comparison of environmental impacts of rice cultivation in diverse locations .

Several LCA case studies on the impacts of rice cultivation in multiple
N. Escobar et al.

Journal of Environmental Management 310 (2022) 114722
regions can be found in the literature, though none of them in African countries - see Table S2 1 in the ESM. In this section, the life cycle impacts of rice from the present study are compared to those from available literature in other geographical contexts by focusing on CC, TA and OD at the midpoint level, as the most common indicators with the same units as in this study. The impacts are discussed considering differences between the systems examined as well as other methodological choices related to the LCA application. All the LCA studies considered employ a mass-based FU, although the moisture content of the grain differs or is not always indicated. Whenever possible and for comparison purposes, yield in Table S2 is expressed as rice with 14% moisture - the recommended moisture for dried rice to avoid damage and deterioration (FAO, 1992). Impact values are thus recalculated per kg of paddy rice with the same moisture content, from cradle to farm gate only. As can be seen, many studies do not specify the rice variety, although this is a crucial factor in determining nutrient requirements and subsequent yields (Inthapanya et al., 2000).

As for the environmental evaluation, most studies focus on GHG emissions, alone (e.g. Hayashi et al., 2016; Yodkhum et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021) or combined with other indicators (e.g. Harun et Al., 2021; Hokazono and Hayashi, 2012; Nguyen Et Al., 2019). All CC results are in the same order of magnitude as those obtained in this study for both CONV and INT scenarios, which are 2.1 kg CO2-eq. and 1.6 kg CO2-eq., respectively, per kg of rice with 14% moisture. CO2-eq. results in the reviewed studies vary from 0.14 kg in organic production systems in Malaysia (Harun et al., 2021) to 5.6 kg in conventional irrigated systems in Thailand during the dry season (Thanawong et al., 2014). The yield
considered in the former is 8 t ha- 1 (grain moisture not specified) and around 2.2 t ha- 1 in the latter. GHG emissions greatly depend on the fertiliser application doses and their impact on yields. Due to this interaction, changing crop management can have opposite effects. For instance, Saber et al. (2020) and Harun et al. (2021) respectively estimate twofold and threefold reductions in the carbon footprint of rice when switching from conventional to organic farming. It should be noted that Saber et al. (2020) do not specify whether they include on-field emissions of CH4 in the LCI, nor the quantification method. In contrast, other studies show that reducing the input intensity increases GHG emissions. This is due to yield decreases, which can be >20% (Hayashi et al., 2016; Hokazono and Hayashi, 2012); or due to increases in on-field emissions from organic fertilisers (Jirapornvaree et al., 2021). The studies of conventional farms in Italy (Fusi et al., 2014) and consolidated farms in Iran (Khoshnevisan et al., 2014) present CC results below 1 kg CO2-eq. kg- 1, for scenarios with relatively high yields (>5 t ha- 1) as combined with net N application of 82 and 203 kg ha- 1, respectively. The case studies in Yodkhum et al. (2017, 2018) deliver CC results around 0.6 kg CO2-eq. kg- 1, with yields around 3.7 t ha- 1 in both cases. This can be related to the share of N applied through organic fertilisers such as compost or bio-ferment juice. Khoshnevisan et al. (2014) show that increasing the level of mechanisation can have positive effects on both, yields and environmental impacts.

Incorporating the straw into the soil increases on-field CH4 emissions and hence the contribution to CC. However, total CC values of some studies considering this practice are lower than in this study (Fusi et al., 2014; Hokazono and Hayashi, 2012; Rahman et al., 2019; Yodkhum et al., 2017). Fusi et al. (2014) consider a long fallow after straw incorporation (more than 30 days), which reduces CH4 emissions. The authors show that straw removal requires higher mineral fertiliser doses to compensate for nutrient removal, causing increased N emissions; while CH4 emissions are reduced because there is less organic matter in the soil. The authors also found that removing the straw could help mitigate CC and other impacts such as TA or OD. Other studies consider straw burning, assuming that it is carbon neutral (Harun et al., 2021; Hayashi et al., 2016; Jimmy et al., 2017; Saber et al., 2020). When associated emissions are included, rice straw incorporation into the soil or direct combustion for electricity generation prove better than burning in terms of CC and other environmental impacts (Yodkhum et al., 2018). Jirapornvaree et al. (2021) identify CH4 emissions from straw residue fermentation as a GHG emission hotspot in organic rice production in Thailand. Nguyen et al. (2019) find that partial and complete removal of rice straw reduces GHG emissions by 30-40% compared to complete straw retention, based on direct field measurements in Philippines.

On-field emissions are identified as the main contributor to most environmental impacts, including CC (Fusi et al., 2014; Harun et al., 2021; He et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020; Yodkhum et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021). The production of fertilisers (compost) and machinery operations can also be important impact sources (Bacenetti et al., 2016; Jimmy et al., 2017; Khoshnevisan et al., 2014). Therefore, the methods used to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions are particularly decisive in LCAs of rice. The IPCC Tier 1 approach is the most widely applied according to Table S2. Exceptions to this are: Hayashi et al. (2016), who measured CH4 fluxes in experimental plots while using IPCC's Tier 2 approach for N2O emissions; Hokazono and Hayashi (2012), who estimated N2O emissions under IPCC's Tier 2 approach; Thanawong et al. (2014), who used Tier 2 EFs for Thailand; He et al. (2018), who used the DNDC 9.5 model for CH4 and CO2 emissions and N leaching (EOS, 2012); and Brodt et al. (2014), who averaged CH4 and N2O emission data from direct measurements in eight on-field studies in California. The latter authors highlight that their approach yields substantially lower GHG emissions than those obtained using the IPCC's Tier 1 approach. The Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model (EOS, 2012) is a mechanistic model (Tier 3) that can also be used to estimate on-field emissions of paddy rice systems by incorporating several hydrological factors and irrigation information (He et al., 2018), in addition to crop-specific data

This 8-year period covers +/-4 years around the year in which the field work finished (2017). The publications were subsequently reviewed to select those that addressed irrigated paddy rice systems and could be compared to the present study, based on their goal and scope, indicators considered and other methodological aspects.

(e.g. maximum biomass or biomass C/N ratio). For instance, Lin et al. (2021) employed the DNDC model to simulate CH4 and N2O emissions and yields in various rotation systems with rice over different years, departing from their own measurements.

In this study, the application of LEACHN model yields higher N2O emissions than would be obtained with the EFs from IPCC (2019). Using the Tier 1 EF for flooded paddies, 1.18 kg N2O ha- 1 would be released in the CONV scenario (including direct and indirect emissions), much lower than the value in Table 7. This would imply a 27% lower CC impact per FU. It must be noted that N2O emissions are very sensitive to soil characteristics and water management, which should ideally be captured by dynamic models as the one used in this study. As a limitation, LEACHN estimates N emissions to air without differentiating between N2O and NOx, though the latter is not a GHG. Given the contribution of CH4 to the impacts of paddy rice production, it is recommended to apply higher tiers for the estimation of these emissions, instead of average Tier 1 EFs, as used in the present study. Tier 2 EFs have been estimated mainly for South Eastern Asian countries, including largest rice producers (Yan et al., 2003a,b). In their meta-analysis of field measurements in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta, Vo et al. (2020) conclude that season-based EFs could be more useful than zone-based EFs to capture variability in GHG emissions. They also show the high sensitivity of microbial CH4 production to salinity. In the absence of Tier 2 EFs for African countries (see section 2.1.3), the use of Tier 3 mechanistic models would be desirable to capture these effects in the SRV. This involves identifying all site-specific CH4 emission pools and influencing factors, e.g. planting dates, soil temperature and texture, water management, plant physiology and biology, etc.; with the associated data and simulation challenges (Sass and Fisher, 1997).

When looking at TA impacts, the results of this study are also of the same order of magnitude as those in Table S2. Only the study of Bacenetti et al. (2016) for organic rice stands out for the significantly higher SO2-eq. emissions than other studies (0.2 kg per kg of paddy rice with 14% moisture), which show values in the range of 0.01-0.05 kg (Fusi et al., 2014; Jimmy et al., 2017; Thanawong et al., 2014). Bacenetti et al. (2016) consider the highest N application doses among studies (471 kg ha- 1), including compost. He et al. (2018) and Khoshnevisan et al. (2014) obtain lower TA values than this study, when assessing conventional and organic rice in China and Iran, respectively, despite the higher N doses applied. In the case of He et al. (2018), this can be partly explained by the relatively higher yields, i.e. between 6.2 and 8.3 t ha- 1. NH3 emissions from fertilisers application are the main contributor to TA across studies, including this one. Differences in NH3 emission estimates partly originate from the quantification method used, among other factors. OD impacts show a wide range of variability across studies, between 7.6 10- 8 (Bacenetti et al., 2016) and 8.3 10- 2 kg CFC-11-eq. per kg of paddy rice (Thanawong et al., 2014); again related to yield variability. The reviewed studies identify machinery use for agricultural practices as a major contributor to this impact, especially in organic production systems. OD is here quantified at 2.4 10- 5 and 2.0 10- 7 kg CFC-11-eq. in CONV and INT scenarios, respectively. These intermediate values are, on the one hand, related to the low mechanisation level of the practices applied by the UFPRRB and, on the other hand, to the relatively high N2O emission intensity per hectare (see sub-sections 3.1 and 3.2). It must be noted that previous LCIA methods, like ReCiPe v1 (Huijbregts et al., 2016), did not take into account the OD potential of this substance given its different mode of action.

The results from the comparative analysis must be interpreted with care, considering differences in yields and agricultural practices, mainly N application but also other aspects such as straw management or the mechanisation level. Crop management practices influence both GHG emissions (especially CH4) and crop yields. The challenge is to identify those practices that reduce CH4 emissions without decreasing crop yields. In general, this can be achieved with the use of high-yielding varieties and efficient use of inputs, but actual improvements are subject to the geographic scope and local/regional conditions (Hayashi
et al., 2016). The yield estimated here for the CONV scenario is very similar to that for organic rice produced in Italy (Bacenetti et al., 2016) in terms of fresh matter with 14% moisture (Table S2). While in the former 179 kg N ha- 1 are applied as urea and DAP, the latter study considers fertilisation with green manure (133 kg N ha- 1) and compost (338 kg N ha- 1), which implies that organic N is not immediately available. Studies based in other producing regions also estimate yields around the value in CONV, despite substantial differences in management practices (e.g. Hokazono and Hayashi, 2012; Jimmy Et Al., 2017; Nguyen Et Al., 2019). Similarly, the theoretical yields in the two SAED scenarios are similar to those obtained in Malaysia (Rahman et al., 2019) or in consolidated farms in Iran (Khoshnevisan et al., 2014), with a similar N input intensity per hectare. Hayashi et al. (2016) also obtain yields around 6 t ha- 1, but with much lower N application doses, which corresponds to a more efficient management. In this study, the yield in the INT scenario is close to the values for conventional rice production in Italy (Fusi et al., 2014) and organic rice production in subtropical China (He et al., 2018); despite differences in fertilisation, e.g. pig manure in the latter, while in the former fertilisation is based on the nutrient removal by crop without additional nutrient application. The highest yield (9.3 t ha- 1) is obtained by Brodt et al. (2014) in California with only 170 kg N ha- 1; followed by Xu et al. (2020) and Zhang et al. (2021), both with yields >8 t ha- 1 in Hubei Province (China).

4.2. Limitations of the study and recommendations for increasing rice sustainability in the SRV .

From the results of this study, as well as from the literature review in section 4.1, several aspects can be identified as key to improve irrigated rice production under financial and logistical constraints. The timely start of the cropping season, fertiliser management, and bird damage control had been previously identified as the main factors determining rice yield in the SRV (Tanaka et al., 2015). As for fertilisation, this LCA shows that following the SAED recommendations for fertiliser application and timing could reduce environmental impacts relative to conventional practices, especially when splitting top-dressing fertilisation in three applications. This may be also beneficial from the economic point of view. Although increasing N doses usually translates into higher yields, the residual mineral N in soil also increases, potentially increasing N emissions in the next crop, as discussed in section 3.1. Among the few studies tackling the relation between N fertilization and CH4 emissions, Linquist et al. (2012) and Zhang et al. (2014) found that the latter can increase with low mineral N application doses and vice versa. Hence, finding a balance between increased productivity and GHG emissions is recommended, ideally with moderate N application doses (Zhang et al., 2014). It would be interesting to explore other fertilisation alternatives, considering those products available in the region. For instance, ammonium sulphate has been proposed instead of urea as a source of N, as it can reduce CH4 emissions by between 10% and 67% (Wassmann et al., 2000). Based on the latter study, this could be explained by the competition between sulphate-reducing and methanogenic bacteria. The specific GHG effects of applying ammonium sulphate should ideally be assessed with field measurements of CH4 emissions in relation to soil and climatic conditions in the SRV; as the above-referred study, carried out in Asia.

Properly identifying weed problems is necessary to adopt effective control measures, as it was observed that the herbicides chosen in RossBethio did not target all weeds. Some surveyed farmers noted that rice rotation with horticultural crops helps prevent weeds. It would also be advisable to select those herbicides with lower toxicity, which may be challenging given the limited access to the most advanced pesticide products. UFPRRB farmers and project technicians also indicated that the use of a combine harvester increases yields relative to manual harvesting because postharvest losses are reduced. This effect is captured in the two reference SAED scenarios, which are theoretically associated with higher yields than CONV. The actual yield effects of the agricultural

practices recommended by the SAED, as well as their environmental and economic implications, should be better examined by implementing them in situ, though this was not possible in the course of this 2-year project.

Based on the literature, other options for improvement could be contemplated in the context of the SRV. Water management has been widely studied as a strategy to reduce both CH4 emissions and irrigation water doses. Along these lines, mid-season drainage, early-season drainage, or alternative wetting and drying have shown positive effects (Islam et al., 2018). Although N2O emissions may increase during dry periods, potential GHG benefits from reducing CH4 normally outweigh this effect (Yan et al., 2009). Implementing intermittent irrigation in Ross Bethio may however entail technological challenges, since this requires excellent land levelling, enough water availability during critical periods of growth, good irrigation infrastructure, and efficient weed control, which may not be guaranteed in the region (Dobermann, 2004). Indeed, project technicians working with the UFPRRB farmers identified bad levelling as a problem for irrigation and mechanisation. Irrigation infrastructure is deficient across West Africa in general (Tanaka et al., 2015); and in the SRV in particular, where it requires large and efficient public irrigation schemes to be implemented (Balasubramanian et al., 2007; Krupnik et al., 2012). Soil salinity is an additional limitation for the UFPRRB to establish intermittent irrigation, as salt accumulates in dry periods, while flooding washes it. Improving irrigation infrastructure in Ross Bethio should become the priority to increase water use efficiency and reduce production costs, while delivering further environmental benefits. Controlling water regimes during fallow periods is also decisive for the environmental performance of rice cultivation. On the one hand, non-flooded preseason for more than 180 days before the cultivation period decreases CH4 emissions (IPCC, 2019). On the other hand, non-flooded fallow can lead to salt accumulation through water evaporation from the soil surface. Balasubramanian et al. (2007) recommend mulching as a mean to reduce both evaporation and salt accumulation.

The UFPRRB uses rice straw to feed free-roaming cattle, avoiding negative environmental consequences from straw burning (Yodkhum et al., 2018). At the same time, this decreases CH4 emissions from the organic matter decomposition that takes place when the straw is incorporated into the soil (Fusi et al., 2014), potentially increasing soil salinity. Alternative options could be explored, such as employing the straw as a renewable energy source in biogas or electricity plants, which can yield environmental and economic benefits (Prasad et al., 2020; Soam et al., 2017). However, this would require further investments as well as collaboration between supply chain actors (e.g. through social networks) to link farmers to downstream users of rice straw (Minas et al., 2020). Converting straw to biochar with domestic stoves (Mohammadi et al., 2016) or to biogas (Soam et al., 2017) have proven environmentally friendly alternatives, which could be implemented at the household scale, increasing farmers' income. Finally, biochar application to soil can improve its nutrient content, replacing fertilisers (Mohammadi et al., 2016).

Developing and tailoring varieties tolerant to soil salinity is crucial given the prevailing soil characteristics in the SRV (WARDA, 2002). In irrigated areas, it is also important to evaluate the implications of choosing between shorter duration varieties that allow for two or even three harvests per year or longer duration ones that yield more per individual crop (Van Oort et al., 2016). In the Vietnamese Mekong delta floodplains, Tran et al. (2018) found that doing three harvests per year reduces soil fertility in the long term, which translates into greater fertiliser and pesticide requirements and higher production costs. Shifting to more diversified farming systems instead of intensive monocultures is thus recommended to maintain the long-term profitability of rice production. Farmers should then choose which crops and varieties to include in their crop rotations. Introducing some local legumes increases the N content in the soil, which reduces fertiliser needs and hence costs (Arunrat et al., 2016). Crop rotations could also contribute to more
diversified and healthy diets in regions as the SRV where self-consumption prevails. All these aspects should be carefully considered when defining flexible and tailor-made strategies as an ongoing process to improve the sustainability of SRV rice farms. Finally, integral management practices such as the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) could be considered. This has been proposed as an environmentally-friendly option for resource-poor farmers (Uphoff et al., 2008, 2010). The actual improvements in yields and total factor productivity brought about by the SRI in multiple geographical contexts are still under scrutiny (McDonald et al., 2006; Chapagain et al., 2011; Berkhout et al., 2015). This system is labour-intensive and requires special techniques and other resources that are not readily available for farmers in the SRV, such as transplanting of young seedlings with much lower plant densities than usual, the use of high amounts of organic amendments, mechanical weed control or alternate wetting and drying (AWD).

5. Conclusions .

This study combines LCA and financial LCC to assess the sustainability of rice production in the region of Saint Louis in Senegal, which is highly import-dependent, like most Sub-Saharan African countries. Specifically, rice cultivation in the SRV during the dry seasons of 2016 and 2017 is evaluated, based on observed practices in the municipality of Ross Bethio. The LCI was gathered through a cooperation project with Caritas Spain and Caritas Senegal, aiming to promote sustainable food security in the region. Two scenarios capturing conventional and intensive practices (CONV and INT) are compared to two reference scenarios theoretically defined according to the recommendations of the official agricultural advisory (SAED_2td and SAED_3td). The LCA applies updated and consensus-based impact characterisation methods for WS and human and ecological toxicity, namely AWARE 1.2C (Boulay et al., 2018) and USEtox 2.0 (Fantke et al., 2017a,b). Moreover, N-related emissions are estimated at the Tier 3 level with the LEACHN model, a mechanistic model that simulates N dynamics based on site-specific soil and climate characteristics, and the number and doses of fertiliser application and watering. To increase the consistency and accuracy of the results, it would be advisable to estimate CH4 emissions at the same level of detail, e.g. with Tier 3 mechanistic models or on-site emission measurements. The financial performance is assessed in terms of production costs, income and profits for the farmer.

The intensive practices of INT scenario lead to higher yields and generate the lowest impacts per kg of paddy rice in seven out of the thirteen impact categories assessed. Yet, increased N application may have negative implications on the next crop due to residual N in soil, which should be evaluated from a multi-year perspective. The two reference scenarios perform better in the remaining impact categories, including FwEU, Htx, and TA. Following SAED's recommendations on fertiliser application (in terms of doses and timing) and introducing mechanical harvesting show potential to increase rice yields as well as the environmental and economic sustainability with respect to conventional practices in the SRV. The results highlight the importance of implementing well-designed agricultural practices considering resource constraints in the region. In addition to limited access to machinery and modern fertilisers, farmers in the SRV face challenges associated with soil salinity and droughts. Thus, other strategic options should be considered, mainly investing in irrigation systems to reduce water losses and overall consumption, together with the use of high-yielding seeds tolerant to salinity. The introduction of crop rotations could be considered to diversify food production and ensure the long-term fertility of soil. Most importantly, financial strategies need to be in place to encourage farmers to adopt the best techniques adapted to the edaphoclimatic and socioeconomic characteristics of the production site.

LCA in combination with financial LCC is suitable for assessing the sustainability of alternative management practices; ideally over several years, to capture variability in impacts that are highly dependent on soil

and climate conditions. Although farm income provides an indication of the socioeconomic performance of agricultural systems, additional indicators would be required to address the social dimension, e.g. working conditions of farmers and seasonal workers. Social LCA comes with its own challenges in terms of data collection and indicators, which may be particularly difficult to overcome in the case of smallholder agriculture in Africa. Experiential learning based on information exchange between farmers, researchers and extension agents could help inform further crop management decisions. However, research projects in West Africa face several implementation challenges that often lead to abandonment. LCT is here presented as a decision-support tool for the sustainable management of rice production systems, with the aim to contribute to the availability of staple crops in Africa. More integral strategies targeting all supply chain actors (farmers, regional traders, companies, governments, and consumers) through private-public partnerships would be desirable to boost sustainable food security in the region and effectively contribute to SDG1 and SDG2.

Yield, water productivity and nutrient balances under the System of Rice Intensification and Recommended Management Practices in the Sahel .

Consumer demand for rice in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is increasing faster than for any other cereal. Governments in the Sahel are responding by promoting double-cropping of irrigated rice in the region's river basins, although rising fertilizer and water costs cast doubt on the future profitability of such systems. Despite controversy, the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is widely promoted as a potential solution to this dilemma. SRI includes transplanting young, single seedlings at wide spacing, compost application, mechanical weed control, and alternate wetting and drying irrigation. However, independent evaluation of the system in comparison to an appropriate control is lacking in SSA, and the Sahel in particular. Responding to this need, we compared SRI to flooded rice production following regionally Recommended Management Practices (RMP), in a five-season experiment in the Senegal River Valley. Our objectives were to evaluate yield, water productivity, fertilizer nitrogen recovery efficiency, partial macronutrient balances and soil quality under both management systems. But because compost production in the Sahel is constrained by low labor and biomass availability, we replaced these materials with waste rice straw, and compared the impact of sole mineral fertilizer application to rice straw residue incorporation with fertilizer addition, under both SRI and RMP. In seasons 1-3, fertilizer alone significantly increased yield, with no differences found between management systems. In season 4, beneficial effects of straw incorporation and fertilizer addition were observed, as significant additive increases in yield, straw and fertilizer nitrogen recovery were found for each management system. In season 5, additive benefits were found only for SRI, although SRI yields never exceeded any fertility management treatment under RMP. Across seasons, water savings from 16% to 48% were obtained with SRI, resulting in significant (11%-45%) increases in water productivity. Combined straw incorporation and fertilizer application helped stabilize partial nitrogen and potassium balances across management systems. Compared to controls, straw incorporation also increased total soil nitrogen and carbon. In contrast to the literature on SRI in the Sahel, our findings indicate that when nutrient additions are held constant, significant yield increases should not be expected over conventionally recommended rice crop management systems. However, should farmers choose to experiment with SRI to reduce water use, they would be most likely to benefit from combining rice straw incorporation with mineral fertilizer, although several seasons may be required for additive yield effects to occur.

evaporative demand of the hot and arid climate (de Vries et al., 2010). In response to the rapidly expanding consumer demand for rice, 200,000 ha of irrigation facilities reliant on diesel or electrical water pumping have been constructed in the Sahel (Balasubramanian et al., 2007 updated with FAOSTAT, 2012). With a per capita rice consumption rate of 111 kg year-1, Senegal is both the Sahel's and Africa's largest rice importer (FAOSTAT, 2012). Cereal import dependency undermines food security, and increases vulnerability to price shocks, underscoring the need to increase domestic rice productivity (Seck et al., 2010). Raising annual rice output requires exploitation of both wet- and dry-season production. However, Senegalese

armers face increasing input costs due to reductions in ferilizer subsidies and rising fuel prices. Because of increases in he latter, irrigation costs comprise 21-45% of farmers' budgets Krupnik et al., 2012). Combined with increasing municipal water emand and predictions of climate-change induced water scarcity Lahtela, 2003), improving water productivity in Sahelian irriated rice has become an important objective (de Vries et al., 010).

Numerous water-saving technologies for rice have been valiated in Asia, though they remain relatively untested and are not et recommended anywhere in Africa. Most notable are aerobic ice (e.g. Bouman et al., 2007), alternate wetting and drying, or WD (e.g. Belder et al., 2005), and the System of Rice Intensifiation, or SRI (Uphoff et al., 2010). Of these, SRI has attracted the ost attention. SRI techniques include line transplanting of single oung seedlings at wide spacing, mechanical weed control, AWD rrigation, and the application of organic soil fertility amendments, referably compost or manure. SRI's advocates argue these techiques provide very high yields and improve water productivity Uphoff et al., 2010). SRI is now supported by institutions ranging rom farmers' organizations to NGOs and the World Bank, and is romoted in 47 countries globally (CIIFAD, 2011), though its poplarity has not come without controversy. For example, McDonald t al. (2006) argued that SRI yields were no higher than Recomended Management Practices (RMP), and this suggestion spurred onsiderable debate (see McDonald et al., 2008; Uphoff et al., 008).

In addition to yield performance, SRI promotion focuses on ssertions of increased water and nutrient use efficiency. However, eer-reviewed studies presenting scientifically sound data to suport these claims are scant in Africa, while the little work that has een done entails conflicting results. In Mozambique, for example, enete et al. (2008) recorded a 41-46% yield depression on saltffected soils with SRI; while in Madagascar, Barison and Uphoff 2010) documented higher macronutrient recovery and yield comared to farmers' practices. In another study in the same location, RI yields as high as 9.9 t ha-1 were recorded, though rather than ttributing them to SRI per se, Tsujimoto et al. (2009) suggested hey resulted from repetitive, deep tillage and incorporation of up o 35 t compost ha-1 (dry weight equivalent). In the Sahel, interest n SRI has grown following reports of 66% yield increases, 10% water avings, and a doubling of farmers' revenues in Mali (Styger et al., 010), though they compared SRI to current, lower-bound farmers' ractices alone, thereby avoiding comparison to an upper-bound MP control. As McDonald et al. (2006) suggested, the latter pracice could have given similar, if not more favorable results than RI.

To make such a comparison, we present five seasons of results rom an experiment evaluating yield, water productivity, nitroen recovery efficiencies, partial macronutrient balances and soil uality effects of both SRI and RMP. Manure or compost are preerred fertility inputs in SRI. In Mali, for instance, single-season valuations of SRI have used up to 13 t ha-1 of manure in addiion to chemical fertilizers (Styger et al., 2010). However, in the roader Sahel, where compost production and manure applicaion are constrained by low biomass and labor availability, the eason-to-season sustainability of such high application rates is uestionable.

In order to adapt this SRI component to local circumstances, we nstead compared the impact of sole fertilizer application, to fertilzer combined with waste rice straw incorporation as an organic
atter input, in both SRI and RMP. We hypothesized that with qual nutrient additions, yields in the first few seasons of the xperiment would not differ significantly between crop manageent systems. However, we expected that SRI would demonstrate igher water productivity, with stronger yield benefits resulting

from straw incorporation and fertilizer addition in the long term, due to increased soil aeration and more rapid residue decomposition under AWD.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Site description
A field experiment was conducted at the Africa Rice Center's Regional Sahel Station at Ndiaye in the Senegal River delta (16o11'N, 16o15'W). Trials were conducted in both the dry and wet season, spanning the 2007-2009 wet seasons. Climate data were collected 300 m from the experiment in a cropped rice field (Fig. 1). Ndiaye's soil is an Orhithionic Gleysol (FAO, 2006), and is comprised of oceanic sediments overlain by alluvial deposits. Texture (0-20 cm) is 16-44-40% sand, silt and clay (Haefele, 2001). Although subsoil materials of marine origin can cause serious soil salinity problems in the region (Ceuppens et al., 1997), initial electrical conductivity was low. Soil properties before the experiment were 0.87 g total N kg-1 and 9.6 g total C kg-1 (analysis with a Vario Max Dry Combustion Analyzer, Elementar Americas, Mt. Laurel, NJ following the IOS (1998)), 5.81 kg P-Olsen kg-1 (measured following extraction in 0.5 M NaHCO3 at pH 8.5 (Olsen et al., 1954)), 0.47 cmol exchangeable K kg-1 (atomic absorption spectroscopy after extraction in 1 M NH4OAc at pH 7), pH of 4.76 (1:2.5 H20 saturated paste) and EC 0.33 dS m-1 (1:5 H20 saturated paste).
2.2. Experimental design and establishment
A split-plot experiment with four replicates was established. Main plots were crop management systems, RMP and SRI (Table 1). Sub-plots measured 25 m2, and consisted of four randomized treatments:
1. A no straw or mineral fertilizer additions control treatment (-ST-F). 2. A straw-only control treatment with 5 t ha-1 (dry weight) rice straw incorporated before transplanting, but without mineral fertilizer (+ST-F). 3. Mineral fertilizer only (-St+F). 4. Rice straw incorporation at the same rate and timing as the straw
only control followed by mineral fertilizer application (+ST+F).

In plots receiving fertilizer, DAP was applied basally (19.3 and 21.5 kg N and P ha-1), and three urea splits were broadcasted into 1-5 cm of water (101.3 kg N ha-1; 40% at early-tillering, 40% at panicle initiation, and 20% at heading). Fertilizer K is generally not recommended by extension officials because of high soil-K reserves (Haefele et al., 2004), and was therefore excluded. Before the experiment, soils were ploughed and disk-harrowed, after which bunds were constructed to isolate main plots. An additional bund was built to contain sub-plots within main plots, and plastic sheeting was installed over all main and sub-plot bunds to 0.5 m depth to eliminate seepage. A 4 m space was also maintained between main plots to prevent lateral water movement.

In the 2007 wet season, rice straw obtained from a neighboring farm was incorporated (0-15 cm depth) into damp soil with a hoe 15 days before transplanting, after which plots were leveled. In subsequent seasons, straw was incorporated 19-21 days before transplanting. Straw N and C concentrations were determined by combustion (Vario Max N/C Analyzer, Elementar Americas, Mt. Laurel, NJ, Table 2). Phosphorus and potassium were determined following Yoshida et al. (1976) and Walinga et al. (1989). The short-duration O. sativa cultivar Sahel-108 (IR-13240-1082-2-3) was grown during all seasons. Transplanting for both

anagement systems took place on 7 (2007 and 2008 wet season) nd 25 (2009 wet season) August and on 19 March (2008 and 2009 ry season).
.3. Water inflows and water table depths
Water used for seedbeds, land preparation and postransplanting irrigation was quantified by recording the height f water passing through V-notched weirs placed at the inlet of eedbeds and main plots, at 1-min intervals for seedbeds, and -min intervals for main-plots, respectively. After passage through he weir, water was equally distributed to sub-plots. Irrigation was alculated as:
= 13.8 tan
( ) H2.5 (1)
here Q is water discharged (l min-1), is the angle of the weir, and is the water head level (cm) measured before passing through the -notch (USBR, 2001). Q was combined with precipitation and conerted to m3 of water ha-1 applied for the entire season. Field water eight within sub-plots was measured daily in open-ended, perfoated PVC tubes (30 cm diameter). Ground water depths (0-1.5 m) utside experimental plots were similarly monitored with 12 PVC ubes (6 cm diameter), each placed 4 m from main plots. Percolaion in RMP sub-plots was measured in 60 cm long closed tubes (30 iameter) placed into the subsoil until 45 cm depth. Drainage volme was calculated as the difference in standing field water height mmediately before and after drainage events, multiplied by plot urface area.
.4. Chemical composition of irrigation, flood and rainwater
When a floodwater layer was present, EC was measured at least wice weekly with a portable meter. Water mineral N concenrations were determined during irrigation from a sample taken mmediately before V-notched weirs. Samples were placed on ice, eturned to the lab and filtered through Whatman No. 42 paper. H4 + and NO3 - concentrations were subsequently measured with n auto-analyzer (Seal Analytical, Mequon, WI) following Andersen nd Ingram (1989). Precipitation and floodwater samples, the later collected immediately before drainage events, were analyzed n the same way. Mean irrigation, flood and rainwater mineral N oncentrations were 1.3, 1.7 and 3.6 mg l-1, respectively. Based n previous studies on the same experimental site (Faye, 1996; aefele, 2001; Samba Diene, 1998), P and K concentrations in irrigaion and floodwater were estimated at 0.1 mg P l-1 and 3.2 mg K l-1. verage rainwater P and K concentrations were derived from hornton (1965) and Peri (1985) as 0.03 mg P l-1 and 1.0 mg K l-1.
.5. Soil and plant sampling
Prior to the onset and at the very end of the five-season experment (hence before straw incorporation in the 2007 wet season, nd at harvest of the 2009 wet season), five soil cores (0-15 cm epth) were taken from each plot to assess total N and C, P-Olsen, xchangeable K, pH and EC. Additional cores were retrieved at 0, 0, 30 and 35 days after transplanting, booting, flowering, and harests in all seasons to determine volumetric water content. Yield corrected to 14% moisture content) was measured at physiologial maturity from 6.25 m2 in each sub-plot. Straw yield, sampled rom the same area, was measured fresh and corrected for moisure content using a 300 g oven dried sub-sample. Six additional ills of rice were sampled to determine grain and straw nutrient oncentrations as described above.
Earch 130 (2012) 155-167
2.6. Data analysis
Water productivity of irrigation and rainwater (WP, kg grain m-3 water) was calculated for main-effects as:
Y
I + P (2)
where Y is grain yield (kg ha-1), I is irrigation and P is precipitation (m3) summed for seedbeds, land preparation and the post-transplanting period. The recovery of N derived from incorporated rice straw without fertilizer application was calculated as:
N+ST-F-N-ST-F
STN (3)
where N+ST-F is N in rice biomass (grain N + straw N) ha-1 in the straw-only sub-treatment, N-ST-F is rice biomass N ha-1 in the no straw or fertilizer additions sub-treatment, and STN is kg N ha-1 applied in incorporated rice straw. Conversely, the recovery of N derived from straw when incorporated with fertilizer was calculated as:
N+ST+F-N-ST+F
STN (4)
where N+ST+F is rice biomass N ha-1 in the straw and fertilizer amended sub-treatment and N-ST+F is rice biomass N ha-1 in subtreatments receiving fertilizer only. The recovery of fertilizer N when applied without straw incorporation was next quantified as:
N-ST+F-N-ST-F
FN (5)
with FN being kg fertilizer N applied ha-1. Finally, the recovery of fertilizer N when applied following straw incorporation was calculated as:
N+ST+F-N+ST-F
FN (6)
Partial N-P-K balances over five seasons were estimated as the summed total of N-P-K inputs from mineral fertilizers, straw application, wet deposition and irrigation, minus the sum of N-P-K exports in harvested grain and straw, and in drainage water.

Data for each season were checked for homoscedasticity and normality following Sokal and Rohlf (1995), and analyzed using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS Institute Inc., San Francisco). Yield, nutrient uptake and recovery, water productivity, and soil quality data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant results for separate tests of fertilizer and straw application followed by non-significant interactions indicate additive effects, whereas significant interactions indicate either negative or synergistic effects. When additive or synergistic effects were observed, main management system effects were analyzed.
3. Results
3.1. Grain yield
In the first three experimental seasons, the only significant yield effect was in response to fertilizer application (P < 0.001 for seasons 1-3), which increased yields by an average of 1.7 (2007 wet season), 3.4 (2008 dry season) and 2.6 t ha-1 (2008 wet season) across management systems (Fig. 2). No seasonal differences in yield were observed. In the 2009 dry season, significant management system x fertilizer (P < 0.05) and management system x fertilizer x straw interactions were observed (P < 0.05). Fertilizer application in SRI increased yield by 3.3 and 3.8 t ha-1 when applied alone and in combination with straw, respectively, relative to 3.1 and 2.2 t ha-1 in RMP. The three-way management system x fertilizer x straw interaction was caused by low SRI

ST+F yield, while yield under the same RMP sub-treatment was 0% less than SRI. Both straw and fertilizer application had sigificant yield effects (P < 0.001), though their interaction remained on-significant, indicating additive benefits from their combinaion under both management systems, starting four seasons after traw incorporation began.

In the fifth and final season, a significant system x straw incororation effect (P < 0.001) resulted from higher yields in the +ST-F ub-treatment (4.1 t ha-1) and lower +ST+F yields (6.9 t ha-1) under MP relative to SRI (3.8 and 7.3 t ha-1 for the same treatments). n contrast to previous seasons where only fertilizer significantly ncreased yields, when SRI alone was subject to an ANOVA, -ST-F, ST-F, -ST+F and +ST+F yields were all significantly different P < 0.05), and increased with N application from straw and ferilizers (Fig. 2). In contrast, yields under RMP reverted to a similar attern as the first three seasons, with significant increases only n response to fertilizer (P < 0.001). RMP -ST+F yields were also ignificantly different (P < 0.05) and 22% greater than the correponding SRI sub-treatment. However, no yield differences were ound between management systems when comparing the +ST+F ub-treatment. While a significant additive effect (P < 0.001) of ombined fertilizer and straw application was observed, it occurred nly for SRI. Significant differences between management systems ere also recorded in the last season (P = 0.014), with RMP yieldng slightly more (+0.3 t ha-1) than SRI when averaged across all ub-treatments.
.2. Water management and water productivity
Water inflows to SRI were always significantly less than under MP (P < 0.001 for all seasons). Savings tended to be greater in the ry season, when evaporative demand was higher. The total seaonal volume of irrigation and precipitation used in RMP ranged rom 7537 to 15,632 m3 ha-1 compared to 6345-10,055 m3 ha-1 in RI across seasons (Table 3).

In RMP, field water levels were consistently above the soil surace, with the exception of the first few days after transplanting
hen plots were left moist but not flooded to facilitate seedling
stablishment, and when drainage was performed for herbicide pplication (Fig. 3). Conversely, there was no floodwater in SRI for 2, 52, 53, 54 and 26% of the days in each season from the 2007

wet season to the 2009 dry season. The 2009 wet season had the lowest number of completely non-flooded days because a series of heavy rainfall events raised water levels in exit canals, thereby inhibiting effective drainage. Percolation in RMP was consistently less than 2.2 mm day-1 in RMP, regardless of seasons (data not shown). In general, below-surface field water depths did not exceed -12 cm under SRI, whereas the maximum above surface floodwater measurement was 6 cm. Soil volumetric water content under SRI remained generally higher than 30%, even during non-flooded periods.

Reduced irrigation volume under SRI resulted in consistently and significantly higher WP compared to RMP, ranging from 11% to 45% across seasons (Table 4). No significant correlations between yield and water use were found for either crop management system, and floodwater EC remained consistently below 0.9 dS m-1 across seasons, regardless of treatment (data not shown).
3.3. Nutrient dynamics
3.3.1. Nutrient uptake from straw and fertilizer Fertilizer application alone had a significant positive effect on crop N, P and K uptake in total biomass measured at harvest during the first three experimental seasons (P < 0.001 for each season). In the 2009 dry season, no difference between management systems in uptake of any macronutrient was found. Both fertilizer and straw application significantly increased N, P and K uptake in SRI and RMP during this season (Fig. 4). The occurrence of a significant fertilizer x straw interaction (P < 0.05) for N uptake also indicated synergistic effects resulting from the combination of fertilizer and straw application under both management systems. Conversely, P and K uptake effects remained additive. In the subsequent 2009 wet season, N uptake in grain and straw, averaged across subtreatments, was significantly less in SRI than in RMP (P < 0.01). Significantly (P < 0.05) less fertilizer N (25 kg ha-1) was taken up in the -ST+F treatment in the former as opposed to latter management system (Fig. 4). In contrast, the combination of fertilizer and straw application resulted in similar N uptake for both management systems. Fertilizer application had significant yield effects in RMP, while straw incorporation did not show any significant effect. Conversely, both fertilizer and straw incorporation were significant under SRI, while their interaction was not. Additive effects therefore occurred under SRI only (Fig. 4). The same additive trend was T.J. K Rupnik et al. / Field Crops R Esearch 130 (2012) 155-167

lso observed for P and K uptake under SRI. Straw and grain K conentrations at harvest of the final season ranged from 1.4%-1.9% nd 0.2%-0.4%. No significant differences in K concentrations were bserved between any treatment combination (data not shown).
.3.2. Straw N recovery Regardless of management system, no significant differences
ere observed between straw N recovery at harvest in either

+ST-F or +ST+F sub-treatments, until the 2009 dry season (data not shown). In this season, both SRI and RMP captured significantly (P < 0.01) more N from applied straw under +ST+F than in +ST-F. Under these circumstances, the recovery of straw N exceeded 0.9 kg N kg N-1 for both management systems. This pattern shifted in the 2009 wet season, during which a significant management system x straw interaction (P < 0.01) and significant main effects (P < 0.01) were caused by a very high recovery of straw N at harvest

systems or sub-treatments were observed in this or the following two seasons. In the fourth season, straw incorporation followed by fertilizer application increased the recovery of fertilizer N to 0.43 kg N kg N-1 across management systems. Fertilizer N recovery was also significantly (P < 0.01) higher in SRI compared to RMP (a difference of 0.09 kg N kg N-1), driven by increased recovery in both -ST+F and +ST+F sub-treatments. In the fifth season, a significant management system x fertilizer interaction was observed (P < 0.05), with the recovery of fertilizer N in +ST+F plots reaching 0.64 kg N kg N-1 compared to 0.46 kg N kg N-1 in the -ST+F

ub-treatment in SRI. Conversely, no differences were found etween RMP sub-treatments, nor was the +ST+F sub-treatment in RI significantly higher than either fertilizer sub-treatment under MP.
.4. Partial nutrient balances and soil quality after five cropping easons
.4.1. Partial nutrient balances No significant main effects were found on partial macronutrint balances after five seasons of consecutive cropping. However, hen no fertilizer or straw was applied, highly negative balances ere found under both management systems for N, P and K (Fig. 5). n comparison, straw and fertilizer application each resulted in ignificant and positive N balances measured across management ystems (P < 0.001). Straw application had no effect on P balnces, while fertilizer addition had a small but significant impact P < 0.001), moving P balances towards the positive in RMP and SRI.
ith the exception of the +ST-F sub-treatment, K balances were onsistently negative, irrespective of management system. Relative o controls, highly significant differences were found for K under oth -ST+F and +F+ST sub-treatments (P < 0.001). Under both mangement systems, the negative balance was less severe under the atter treatment (+F+ST). Because SRI used less water during each eason (Table 3), RMP received on average more nutrients via irriation water than SRI over five seasons (72 vs. 46 kg N ha-1, 5 vs.
kg P ha-1 and 167 vs. 114 kg K ha-1). Precipitation imported an stimated 27 kg N, 0.08 kg P and 8 kg K ha-1 to both RMP and SRI lots over the course of five seasons (Fig. 5).
.4.2. Soil quality parameters No significant effects of crop management system, crop
anagement system x fertilizer application, crop manageent system x straw application, nor crop management ystem x fertilizer x straw application were found on soil total N r C, P-Olsen or exchangeable K after five seasons of continuous ropping (Table 6). But when measured across crop management ystems, straw incorporation significantly (P < 0.05) increased total
(with 17%), total C (with 15%) and exchangeable K (with 11%) ompared to non-fertilized (no fertilizer no straw) plots, respecively. Fertilizer application had a near-significant impact on vailable P (P = 0.054), increasing P-Olsen by 21% to 6.9 mg P kg-1. here were no significant differences in soil pH (range 4.7-6.7)
or EC (range 0.40-1.70 dS m-1) between management systems or sub-treatments, although when compared to baseline data taken in 2007 and measured across all plots, the final values for both pH and EC increased by 16% and 215% to means of 5.51 and 1.02 dS m-1 for both parameters (P < 0.001, data not shown).
4. Discussion
4.1. Yield, water savings and water productivity
Water savings ranging from 16%-48% were obtained under SRI in this study, resulting in increased water productivity compared to RMP. In only two of 20 observed cases SRI yields were significantly lower than in comparable RMP sub-treatments (under -ST-F and -ST+F in the 2009 wet season). But while SRI increased water savings and water productivity, no sustained yield or nutrient recovery advantages were found in comparison to any RMP sub-treatment.

Our results therefore indicate that while there is potential for water saving, farmers in the study region are unlikely to realize yield advantages with SRI compared to other improved crop management options when nutrient additions are held constant. This confirms McDonald et al. (2006, 2008), who suggested that SRI's yield benefits were likely to be limited when compared to an appropriate, upper-bound control system. Our results contrast with reports of high-yielding SRI performance in the Sahel where the SRI was compared to lower-bound farmers' practice controls alone, and with highly unequal nutrient additions (e.g. Styger et Al., 2010). Nonetheless, should farmers choose to experiment SRI to save water, our results show that they would be more likely to benefit over the long-term from combined organic matter (straw) and fertilizer application compared to mineral nutrient additions alone.

Reports of increased water productivity with SRI are common in field station experiments (e.g. Zhao Et Al., 2009). But under on-farm conditions, poor land leveling may increase the risk of submergence and plant loss in field depressions where farmers transplant only single, young seedlings and attempt to practice AWD (Krupnik et al., 2012). Similarly, higher field positions may not receive sufficient water and experience increased weed infestation (Rodenburg and Johnson, 2009). Caution should therefore be employed when extrapolating the results of this and other on-station studies to on-farm situations.

RMP) and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) under four fertility treatments ertilizer) in Ndiaye, Senegal. Because plots were rarely drained, drainage values fo ess than 5 kg ha-1 in total.

Ground water depths during the cropping season were generally etween -30 and -70 cm. SRI field water depths never exceeded 12 cm, above the maximum 15 cm depth for ``safe'' AWD with inimal risk of yield loss (Bouman et al., 2007). No correlations
etween water use and yield were observed, indicating that the oot zone in SRI plots was usually either moist or saturated, and hat drought stress was not encountered. Indeed, volumetric water ontent of soils under SRI was generally higher than 30% (data not hown), well above the permanent wilting point of 25% established or this soil by de Vries et al. (2010).

In landscapes with relatively shallow water tables, for examle in riverside depressions as in this study, or in large irrigation chemes with shallow water tables, Belder et al. (2004, 2005) sugested that water savings between 10% and 30% should be possible sing AWD with little yield penalty because rice roots can access ufficient soil moisture from capillary rise. Water-saving potential s also high on finely textured soils (Belder et al., 2007), such as hose in the current study site. Where soils are coarser, or fields re located in more isolated or higher-elevation irrigation schemes, aving water without reducing yield can be more difficult (Tabbal t al., 2002). In the 2009 dry season, very high water savings (48%) ere observed under SRI without significant yield loss compared to MP. Tuong et al. (1994) showed that small-plot experiments with ow bund to surface area ratios can result in unreasonably high eepage rates and exaggeration of estimated water requirements n flooded treatments. Though the bund to area ratio of sub-plots in his experiment was relatively small (0.7 m m-2), we maintain that

water savings are unlikely to have been overestimated because: (i) seepage was minimized by lining bunds with plastic sheeting and installing them into the soil below the plough layer, (ii) bund over-flow was never observed, and (iii) percolation in RMP was low. Also, (iv) evaporative losses are generally higher from ponded water compared to soil surfaces (Belder et al., 2005), and field water levels in SRI were below the surface for 54% of the time for this season. Thus, the water savings observed likely resulted from reduced seepage, careful irrigation in SRI, and higher evaporative floodwater losses from RMP.

The build-up of alkaline salts could also constrain yield in watersaving management systems in the Sahel (de Vries et al., 2010). In this experiment, soil EC increased dramatically after five seasons, confirming previous observations of the impact of double-cropping at the same site (Haefele et al., 2004). However, EC remained well below the threshold of 2.0 dS m-1 after which yield might be affected (Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000), and no differences were found between management systems. But because saline deposits are heterogeneously distributed (Ceuppens et al., 1997), further and longer-term research on the potential interaction between AWD irrigation and salinity should be undertaken.

Despite the water productivity advantages of SRI demonstrated in this study, it must be recognized that SRI is by no means the only method to save water without compromising yield. Evidence of good water savings in conventional management systems where AWD alone is implemented, but where crop establishment, weed and nutrient management remain relatively unchanged compared

o their flooded counterparts, is growing (e.g. Belder et Al., 2004, 005; Cabangon et Al., 2004; De Vries et Al., 2010). Sanjeewanie nd Ranamukharrachchi (2009) contrasted SRI with direct seeding sing AWD in Thailand. Both yield and water productivity were ighest with the latter system. Clearly, further research is needed to racket SRI's performance compared to other management options hat reduce water use.
.2. Recovery of straw and fertilizer nitrogen
Despite the potential for immobilization of fertilizer N when traw residues are incorporated, no negative effects on N uptake ere observed for either system during seasons 1-3 of this experment. In the fourth season, additive N-P-K uptake effects were ound for both crop management systems, but in the fifth and final eason, they were recorded only for SRI. It is not uncommon for sevral seasons to pass before straw incorporation positively affects ield in irrigated rice (Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2005). Delays may esult from the gradual build-up of soil nutrient pools with the susained addition of residues (e.g. Eagle et al., 2000), although when ompared to higher and more balanced mineral N-P-K rates, yield ncreases due to combined organic matter and fertilizer applicaions may not be significant (Dawe et al., 2003). In contrast, the ST+F sub-treatment affected macronutrient uptake more posiively with SRI than RMP in the current study. This suggests that esource-poor farmers unable to afford balanced N-P-K fertilizers ho experiment with SRI could gain from this fertility management trategy, although beneficial effects may only occur after several easons.

The additive SRI yield effects resulting from combined fertilizer nd straw application in the last two seasons of this study can be artially explained by improved recovery both of straw and fertilzer N. In the fourth season, straw N recovery was higher under ST+F compared to +ST-F (a difference of 17 kg ha-1 under SRI nd 7 kg ha-1 under RMP). SRI advocates argue that combined with WD, mechanical weeding aerates the soil and increases N minralization and supply to the crop (Ceesay, 2010; Uphoff et al., 010). However, the improved N uptake and recovery observed n this experiment is unlikely to have been caused by increased oil aeration. Despite the AWD regime, the soil water-status in SRI emained close to saturation. Moreover, volumetric water contents fter weeding tended to be higher than before, because irrigation ad to be introduced to facilitate the movement of rotary weeders. onversely, mechanical weeding may have stimulated mineralizaion by tearing straw into smaller pieces and increasing residue urface area exposed to microbial attack, though additional work is equired to confirm this hypothesis. The recovery of straw N in the ST+F sub-treatment was above 100% in the 2009 wet season, indiating that part of the recovered N was obtained from the labile oil N pool, which was probably augmented through the gradual ecycling of straw N incorporated over the previous four seasons. owever, while improved fertilizer N recovery under SRI has been eported elsewhere (Zhao et al., 2009), it was never statistically uperior to RMP in the current experiment.
.3. Long-term impact on macronutrient balances and soil quality
Both fertilizer and straw inputs, and grain and straw exports, xerted the largest effect on post-experiment partial macronutrient alances in this study. Fertilizer and straw application each posiively affected N balances. Rice straw contains little P, so P balances ere mainly increased by fertilizer alone. And although no fertilzer K was applied, both fertilizer and straw significantly impacted balances. Fertilizer N and P moved K balances towards the negaive because of increased crop growth and uptake of indigenous soil , although in all treatments soil exchangeable K remained above
earch 130 (2012) 155-167 165
the medium K status threshold of 0.45 cmol kg-1, below which fertilizer K might affect yield (Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000). Moreover, no treatment effects on grain or straw K concentrations were observed at harvest in the last season, and levels of each remained above deficiency thresholds according to Dobermann and Fairhurst (2000). But because straw contains large amounts of K, incorporation in +ST-F and +ST+F treatments helped to offset declining partial K balances.

While KCl fertilizer is recommended for double-cropping (Bado et al., 2010), high costs prohibit its use in the Sahel. Haefele et al. (2004) suggested that fertilizer K may not be necessary because equilibrium reactions between exchangeable and high total K reserves in West Africa's river floodplain soils could maintain levels above the critical limit for decades. While this is advantageous for resource-poor farmers unable to afford fertilizer K, we suggest that straw incorporation in double-cropped systems will help to offset losses, thereby prolonging depletion over longer periods of time, thus improving the long-term sustainability of rice cropping. Further research should be conducted to determine if recommended KCl application rates could be reduced where farmers incorporate rice straw, as reduced fertilizer K requirements would make KCl application more affordable, while also helping to maintain soil quality. Future studies should also examine in situ recycling of straw, as opposed to biomass importation as used in the current study. Finally, when measured at the conclusion of the experiment, straw incorporation led to small yet significant increases in total soil C and N compared to controls, arguably improving soil quality in each crop management system. Straw incorporation also supplies micronutrients (Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2005), which we were unable to examine in this study, potentially providing additional agronomic benefits.

Post-experiment estimates of partial macronutrient balances suggested slightly more positive trends for RMP compared to SRI, in part because of greater nutrient inputs through irrigation, although differences were never significant. But in water-saving systems more reliant on drainage, or where less irrigation is needed, differences could be larger. We estimated P and K concentrations in irrigation, rain and floodwater based on previous studies at the same location. Balances may therefore be slightly less accurate than desirable, although significant error is unlikely because concentrations fell within the bounds of the ranges reported in the literature (see Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000). Conversely, gaseous N losses, biological N fixation, leaching, inter-season capillary rise, and dry deposition also play a role in nutrient cycling (Cassman et al., 1998; Haefele, 2001), though we were unable to account for them in this study. Nutrient losses via leaching, however, are unlikely to be large in lowland rice fields (Cassman et al., 1998), especially where soils are finely textured and where water tables remain close to the soil surface. This study therefore provides a first-step towards estimating irrigation, wet deposition, and flood water drainage import and export pathways that are typically not included in partial nutrient balance studies. Additional work is needed to quantify the gaps described above, especially in double-cropped, water-saving rice systems, where import and export pathways could significantly differ.
5. Conclusion
We investigated the potential for water savings and the impact of organic (straw) and inorganic soil fertility amendments on yields and nutrient balances under Recommended Management Practices and the System of Rice Intensification over five seasons in the Senegal River Delta. Our results indicate that substantial water savings and increases in water productivity can be obtained with SRI, although significant yield increases compared to RMP should

ot be expected. Positive effects resulting from straw incorporation ollowed by fertilizer application became apparent in the fourth eason as significant additive increases in yield, straw and fertilizer
recovery were observed under both RMP and SRI. However, coninuation of these trends was only observed for SRI in the fifth and nal season of the experiment, suggesting that integrated organic nd mineral nutrient management of soil fertility is more advanageous with SRI than RMP. Fertilizer and straw additions also had
positive effect on partial macronutrient balances and soil qualty parameters. Further work should be conducted to investigate he mechanisms underlying these results, and to compare SRI's ield and water productivity performance to other water-saving ice management systems. If farmers in the Sahel practicing doubleropping choose to experiment with techniques like SRI to reduce ater use and thus input costs, our findings indicate that they are ost likely to benefit over time by practicing straw residue incororation followed by mineral fertilizer additions, although when utrient additions are held equal, SRI is unlikely to improve yield rends over long-established Recommended Management Pracices.

Yield, water productivity and nutrient balances under the System of Rice Intensification and Recommended Management Practices in the Sahel .

Consumer demand for rice in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is increasing faster than for any other cereal. Governments in the Sahel are responding by promoting double-cropping of irrigated rice in the region's river basins, although rising fertilizer and water costs cast doubt on the future profitability of such systems. Despite controversy, the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is widely promoted as a potential solution to this dilemma. SRI includes transplanting young, single seedlings at wide spacing, compost application, mechanical weed control, and alternate wetting and drying irrigation. However, independent evaluation of the system in comparison to an appropriate control is lacking in SSA, and the Sahel in particular. Responding to this need, we compared SRI to flooded rice production following regionally Recommended Management Practices (RMP), in a five-season experiment in the Senegal River Valley. Our objectives were to evaluate yield, water productivity, fertilizer nitrogen recovery efficiency, partial macronutrient balances and soil quality under both management systems. But because compost production in the Sahel is constrained by low labor and biomass availability, we replaced these materials with waste rice straw, and compared the impact of sole mineral fertilizer application to rice straw residue incorporation with fertilizer addition, under both SRI and RMP. In seasons 1-3, fertilizer alone significantly increased yield, with no differences found between management systems. In season 4, beneficial effects of straw incorporation and fertilizer addition were observed, as significant additive increases in yield, straw and fertilizer nitrogen recovery were found for each management system. In season 5, additive benefits were found only for SRI, although SRI yields never exceeded any fertility management treatment under RMP. Across seasons, water savings from 16% to 48% were obtained with SRI, resulting in significant (11%-45%) increases in water productivity. Combined straw incorporation and fertilizer application helped stabilize partial nitrogen and potassium balances across management systems. Compared to controls, straw incorporation also increased total soil nitrogen and carbon. In contrast to the literature on SRI in the Sahel, our findings indicate that when nutrient additions are held constant, significant yield increases should not be expected over conventionally recommended rice crop management systems. However, should farmers choose to experiment with SRI to reduce water use, they would be most likely to benefit from combining rice straw incorporation with mineral fertilizer, although several seasons may be required for additive yield effects to occur.

evaporative demand of the hot and arid climate (de Vries et al., 2010). In response to the rapidly expanding consumer demand for rice, 200,000 ha of irrigation facilities reliant on diesel or electrical water pumping have been constructed in the Sahel (Balasubramanian et al., 2007 updated with FAOSTAT, 2012). With a per capita rice consumption rate of 111 kg year-1, Senegal is both the Sahel's and Africa's largest rice importer (FAOSTAT, 2012). Cereal import dependency undermines food security, and increases vulnerability to price shocks, underscoring the need to increase domestic rice productivity (Seck et al., 2010). Raising annual rice output requires exploitation of both wet- and dry-season production. However, Senegalese

armers face increasing input costs due to reductions in ferilizer subsidies and rising fuel prices. Because of increases in he latter, irrigation costs comprise 21-45% of farmers' budgets Krupnik et al., 2012). Combined with increasing municipal water emand and predictions of climate-change induced water scarcity Lahtela, 2003), improving water productivity in Sahelian irriated rice has become an important objective (de Vries et al., 010).

Numerous water-saving technologies for rice have been valiated in Asia, though they remain relatively untested and are not et recommended anywhere in Africa. Most notable are aerobic ice (e.g. Bouman et al., 2007), alternate wetting and drying, or WD (e.g. Belder et al., 2005), and the System of Rice Intensifiation, or SRI (Uphoff et al., 2010). Of these, SRI has attracted the ost attention. SRI techniques include line transplanting of single oung seedlings at wide spacing, mechanical weed control, AWD rrigation, and the application of organic soil fertility amendments, referably compost or manure. SRI's advocates argue these techiques provide very high yields and improve water productivity Uphoff et al., 2010). SRI is now supported by institutions ranging rom farmers' organizations to NGOs and the World Bank, and is romoted in 47 countries globally (CIIFAD, 2011), though its poplarity has not come without controversy. For example, McDonald t al. (2006) argued that SRI yields were no higher than Recomended Management Practices (RMP), and this suggestion spurred onsiderable debate (see McDonald et al., 2008; Uphoff et al., 008).

In addition to yield performance, SRI promotion focuses on ssertions of increased water and nutrient use efficiency. However, eer-reviewed studies presenting scientifically sound data to suport these claims are scant in Africa, while the little work that has een done entails conflicting results. In Mozambique, for example, enete et al. (2008) recorded a 41-46% yield depression on saltffected soils with SRI; while in Madagascar, Barison and Uphoff 2010) documented higher macronutrient recovery and yield comared to farmers' practices. In another study in the same location, RI yields as high as 9.9 t ha-1 were recorded, though rather than ttributing them to SRI per se, Tsujimoto et al. (2009) suggested hey resulted from repetitive, deep tillage and incorporation of up o 35 t compost ha-1 (dry weight equivalent). In the Sahel, interest n SRI has grown following reports of 66% yield increases, 10% water avings, and a doubling of farmers' revenues in Mali (Styger et al., 010), though they compared SRI to current, lower-bound farmers' ractices alone, thereby avoiding comparison to an upper-bound MP control. As McDonald et al. (2006) suggested, the latter pracice could have given similar, if not more favorable results than RI.

To make such a comparison, we present five seasons of results rom an experiment evaluating yield, water productivity, nitroen recovery efficiencies, partial macronutrient balances and soil uality effects of both SRI and RMP. Manure or compost are preerred fertility inputs in SRI. In Mali, for instance, single-season valuations of SRI have used up to 13 t ha-1 of manure in addiion to chemical fertilizers (Styger et al., 2010). However, in the roader Sahel, where compost production and manure applicaion are constrained by low biomass and labor availability, the eason-to-season sustainability of such high application rates is uestionable.

In order to adapt this SRI component to local circumstances, we nstead compared the impact of sole fertilizer application, to fertilzer combined with waste rice straw incorporation as an organic
atter input, in both SRI and RMP. We hypothesized that with qual nutrient additions, yields in the first few seasons of the xperiment would not differ significantly between crop manageent systems. However, we expected that SRI would demonstrate igher water productivity, with stronger yield benefits resulting

from straw incorporation and fertilizer addition in the long term, due to increased soil aeration and more rapid residue decomposition under AWD.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Site description
A field experiment was conducted at the Africa Rice Center's Regional Sahel Station at Ndiaye in the Senegal River delta (16o11'N, 16o15'W). Trials were conducted in both the dry and wet season, spanning the 2007-2009 wet seasons. Climate data were collected 300 m from the experiment in a cropped rice field (Fig. 1). Ndiaye's soil is an Orhithionic Gleysol (FAO, 2006), and is comprised of oceanic sediments overlain by alluvial deposits. Texture (0-20 cm) is 16-44-40% sand, silt and clay (Haefele, 2001). Although subsoil materials of marine origin can cause serious soil salinity problems in the region (Ceuppens et al., 1997), initial electrical conductivity was low. Soil properties before the experiment were 0.87 g total N kg-1 and 9.6 g total C kg-1 (analysis with a Vario Max Dry Combustion Analyzer, Elementar Americas, Mt. Laurel, NJ following the IOS (1998)), 5.81 kg P-Olsen kg-1 (measured following extraction in 0.5 M NaHCO3 at pH 8.5 (Olsen et al., 1954)), 0.47 cmol exchangeable K kg-1 (atomic absorption spectroscopy after extraction in 1 M NH4OAc at pH 7), pH of 4.76 (1:2.5 H20 saturated paste) and EC 0.33 dS m-1 (1:5 H20 saturated paste).
2.2. Experimental design and establishment
A split-plot experiment with four replicates was established. Main plots were crop management systems, RMP and SRI (Table 1). Sub-plots measured 25 m2, and consisted of four randomized treatments:
1. A no straw or mineral fertilizer additions control treatment (-ST-F). 2. A straw-only control treatment with 5 t ha-1 (dry weight) rice straw incorporated before transplanting, but without mineral fertilizer (+ST-F). 3. Mineral fertilizer only (-St+F). 4. Rice straw incorporation at the same rate and timing as the straw
only control followed by mineral fertilizer application (+ST+F).

In plots receiving fertilizer, DAP was applied basally (19.3 and 21.5 kg N and P ha-1), and three urea splits were broadcasted into 1-5 cm of water (101.3 kg N ha-1; 40% at early-tillering, 40% at panicle initiation, and 20% at heading). Fertilizer K is generally not recommended by extension officials because of high soil-K reserves (Haefele et al., 2004), and was therefore excluded. Before the experiment, soils were ploughed and disk-harrowed, after which bunds were constructed to isolate main plots. An additional bund was built to contain sub-plots within main plots, and plastic sheeting was installed over all main and sub-plot bunds to 0.5 m depth to eliminate seepage. A 4 m space was also maintained between main plots to prevent lateral water movement.

In the 2007 wet season, rice straw obtained from a neighboring farm was incorporated (0-15 cm depth) into damp soil with a hoe 15 days before transplanting, after which plots were leveled. In subsequent seasons, straw was incorporated 19-21 days before transplanting. Straw N and C concentrations were determined by combustion (Vario Max N/C Analyzer, Elementar Americas, Mt. Laurel, NJ, Table 2). Phosphorus and potassium were determined following Yoshida et al. (1976) and Walinga et al. (1989). The short-duration O. sativa cultivar Sahel-108 (IR-13240-1082-2-3) was grown during all seasons. Transplanting for both

anagement systems took place on 7 (2007 and 2008 wet season) nd 25 (2009 wet season) August and on 19 March (2008 and 2009 ry season).
.3. Water inflows and water table depths
Water used for seedbeds, land preparation and postransplanting irrigation was quantified by recording the height f water passing through V-notched weirs placed at the inlet of eedbeds and main plots, at 1-min intervals for seedbeds, and -min intervals for main-plots, respectively. After passage through he weir, water was equally distributed to sub-plots. Irrigation was alculated as:
= 13.8 tan
( ) H2.5 (1)
here Q is water discharged (l min-1), is the angle of the weir, and is the water head level (cm) measured before passing through the -notch (USBR, 2001). Q was combined with precipitation and conerted to m3 of water ha-1 applied for the entire season. Field water eight within sub-plots was measured daily in open-ended, perfoated PVC tubes (30 cm diameter). Ground water depths (0-1.5 m) utside experimental plots were similarly monitored with 12 PVC ubes (6 cm diameter), each placed 4 m from main plots. Percolaion in RMP sub-plots was measured in 60 cm long closed tubes (30 iameter) placed into the subsoil until 45 cm depth. Drainage volme was calculated as the difference in standing field water height mmediately before and after drainage events, multiplied by plot urface area.
.4. Chemical composition of irrigation, flood and rainwater
When a floodwater layer was present, EC was measured at least wice weekly with a portable meter. Water mineral N concenrations were determined during irrigation from a sample taken mmediately before V-notched weirs. Samples were placed on ice, eturned to the lab and filtered through Whatman No. 42 paper. H4 + and NO3 - concentrations were subsequently measured with n auto-analyzer (Seal Analytical, Mequon, WI) following Andersen nd Ingram (1989). Precipitation and floodwater samples, the later collected immediately before drainage events, were analyzed n the same way. Mean irrigation, flood and rainwater mineral N oncentrations were 1.3, 1.7 and 3.6 mg l-1, respectively. Based n previous studies on the same experimental site (Faye, 1996; aefele, 2001; Samba Diene, 1998), P and K concentrations in irrigaion and floodwater were estimated at 0.1 mg P l-1 and 3.2 mg K l-1. verage rainwater P and K concentrations were derived from hornton (1965) and Peri (1985) as 0.03 mg P l-1 and 1.0 mg K l-1.
.5. Soil and plant sampling
Prior to the onset and at the very end of the five-season experment (hence before straw incorporation in the 2007 wet season, nd at harvest of the 2009 wet season), five soil cores (0-15 cm epth) were taken from each plot to assess total N and C, P-Olsen, xchangeable K, pH and EC. Additional cores were retrieved at 0, 0, 30 and 35 days after transplanting, booting, flowering, and harests in all seasons to determine volumetric water content. Yield corrected to 14% moisture content) was measured at physiologial maturity from 6.25 m2 in each sub-plot. Straw yield, sampled rom the same area, was measured fresh and corrected for moisure content using a 300 g oven dried sub-sample. Six additional ills of rice were sampled to determine grain and straw nutrient oncentrations as described above.
Earch 130 (2012) 155-167
2.6. Data analysis
Water productivity of irrigation and rainwater (WP, kg grain m-3 water) was calculated for main-effects as:
Y
I + P (2)
where Y is grain yield (kg ha-1), I is irrigation and P is precipitation (m3) summed for seedbeds, land preparation and the post-transplanting period. The recovery of N derived from incorporated rice straw without fertilizer application was calculated as:
N+ST-F-N-ST-F
STN (3)
where N+ST-F is N in rice biomass (grain N + straw N) ha-1 in the straw-only sub-treatment, N-ST-F is rice biomass N ha-1 in the no straw or fertilizer additions sub-treatment, and STN is kg N ha-1 applied in incorporated rice straw. Conversely, the recovery of N derived from straw when incorporated with fertilizer was calculated as:
N+ST+F-N-ST+F
STN (4)
where N+ST+F is rice biomass N ha-1 in the straw and fertilizer amended sub-treatment and N-ST+F is rice biomass N ha-1 in subtreatments receiving fertilizer only. The recovery of fertilizer N when applied without straw incorporation was next quantified as:
N-ST+F-N-ST-F
FN (5)
with FN being kg fertilizer N applied ha-1. Finally, the recovery of fertilizer N when applied following straw incorporation was calculated as:
N+ST+F-N+ST-F
FN (6)
Partial N-P-K balances over five seasons were estimated as the summed total of N-P-K inputs from mineral fertilizers, straw application, wet deposition and irrigation, minus the sum of N-P-K exports in harvested grain and straw, and in drainage water.

Data for each season were checked for homoscedasticity and normality following Sokal and Rohlf (1995), and analyzed using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS Institute Inc., San Francisco). Yield, nutrient uptake and recovery, water productivity, and soil quality data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant results for separate tests of fertilizer and straw application followed by non-significant interactions indicate additive effects, whereas significant interactions indicate either negative or synergistic effects. When additive or synergistic effects were observed, main management system effects were analyzed.
3. Results
3.1. Grain yield
In the first three experimental seasons, the only significant yield effect was in response to fertilizer application (P < 0.001 for seasons 1-3), which increased yields by an average of 1.7 (2007 wet season), 3.4 (2008 dry season) and 2.6 t ha-1 (2008 wet season) across management systems (Fig. 2). No seasonal differences in yield were observed. In the 2009 dry season, significant management system x fertilizer (P < 0.05) and management system x fertilizer x straw interactions were observed (P < 0.05). Fertilizer application in SRI increased yield by 3.3 and 3.8 t ha-1 when applied alone and in combination with straw, respectively, relative to 3.1 and 2.2 t ha-1 in RMP. The three-way management system x fertilizer x straw interaction was caused by low SRI

ST+F yield, while yield under the same RMP sub-treatment was 0% less than SRI. Both straw and fertilizer application had sigificant yield effects (P < 0.001), though their interaction remained on-significant, indicating additive benefits from their combinaion under both management systems, starting four seasons after traw incorporation began.

In the fifth and final season, a significant system x straw incororation effect (P < 0.001) resulted from higher yields in the +ST-F ub-treatment (4.1 t ha-1) and lower +ST+F yields (6.9 t ha-1) under MP relative to SRI (3.8 and 7.3 t ha-1 for the same treatments). n contrast to previous seasons where only fertilizer significantly ncreased yields, when SRI alone was subject to an ANOVA, -ST-F, ST-F, -ST+F and +ST+F yields were all significantly different P < 0.05), and increased with N application from straw and ferilizers (Fig. 2). In contrast, yields under RMP reverted to a similar attern as the first three seasons, with significant increases only n response to fertilizer (P < 0.001). RMP -ST+F yields were also ignificantly different (P < 0.05) and 22% greater than the correponding SRI sub-treatment. However, no yield differences were ound between management systems when comparing the +ST+F ub-treatment. While a significant additive effect (P < 0.001) of ombined fertilizer and straw application was observed, it occurred nly for SRI. Significant differences between management systems ere also recorded in the last season (P = 0.014), with RMP yieldng slightly more (+0.3 t ha-1) than SRI when averaged across all ub-treatments.
.2. Water management and water productivity
Water inflows to SRI were always significantly less than under MP (P < 0.001 for all seasons). Savings tended to be greater in the ry season, when evaporative demand was higher. The total seaonal volume of irrigation and precipitation used in RMP ranged rom 7537 to 15,632 m3 ha-1 compared to 6345-10,055 m3 ha-1 in RI across seasons (Table 3).

In RMP, field water levels were consistently above the soil surace, with the exception of the first few days after transplanting
hen plots were left moist but not flooded to facilitate seedling
stablishment, and when drainage was performed for herbicide pplication (Fig. 3). Conversely, there was no floodwater in SRI for 2, 52, 53, 54 and 26% of the days in each season from the 2007

wet season to the 2009 dry season. The 2009 wet season had the lowest number of completely non-flooded days because a series of heavy rainfall events raised water levels in exit canals, thereby inhibiting effective drainage. Percolation in RMP was consistently less than 2.2 mm day-1 in RMP, regardless of seasons (data not shown). In general, below-surface field water depths did not exceed -12 cm under SRI, whereas the maximum above surface floodwater measurement was 6 cm. Soil volumetric water content under SRI remained generally higher than 30%, even during non-flooded periods.

Reduced irrigation volume under SRI resulted in consistently and significantly higher WP compared to RMP, ranging from 11% to 45% across seasons (Table 4). No significant correlations between yield and water use were found for either crop management system, and floodwater EC remained consistently below 0.9 dS m-1 across seasons, regardless of treatment (data not shown).
3.3. Nutrient dynamics
3.3.1. Nutrient uptake from straw and fertilizer Fertilizer application alone had a significant positive effect on crop N, P and K uptake in total biomass measured at harvest during the first three experimental seasons (P < 0.001 for each season). In the 2009 dry season, no difference between management systems in uptake of any macronutrient was found. Both fertilizer and straw application significantly increased N, P and K uptake in SRI and RMP during this season (Fig. 4). The occurrence of a significant fertilizer x straw interaction (P < 0.05) for N uptake also indicated synergistic effects resulting from the combination of fertilizer and straw application under both management systems. Conversely, P and K uptake effects remained additive. In the subsequent 2009 wet season, N uptake in grain and straw, averaged across subtreatments, was significantly less in SRI than in RMP (P < 0.01). Significantly (P < 0.05) less fertilizer N (25 kg ha-1) was taken up in the -ST+F treatment in the former as opposed to latter management system (Fig. 4). In contrast, the combination of fertilizer and straw application resulted in similar N uptake for both management systems. Fertilizer application had significant yield effects in RMP, while straw incorporation did not show any significant effect. Conversely, both fertilizer and straw incorporation were significant under SRI, while their interaction was not. Additive effects therefore occurred under SRI only (Fig. 4). The same additive trend was T.J. K Rupnik et al. / Field Crops R Esearch 130 (2012) 155-167

lso observed for P and K uptake under SRI. Straw and grain K conentrations at harvest of the final season ranged from 1.4%-1.9% nd 0.2%-0.4%. No significant differences in K concentrations were bserved between any treatment combination (data not shown).
.3.2. Straw N recovery Regardless of management system, no significant differences
ere observed between straw N recovery at harvest in either

+ST-F or +ST+F sub-treatments, until the 2009 dry season (data not shown). In this season, both SRI and RMP captured significantly (P < 0.01) more N from applied straw under +ST+F than in +ST-F. Under these circumstances, the recovery of straw N exceeded 0.9 kg N kg N-1 for both management systems. This pattern shifted in the 2009 wet season, during which a significant management system x straw interaction (P < 0.01) and significant main effects (P < 0.01) were caused by a very high recovery of straw N at harvest

systems or sub-treatments were observed in this or the following two seasons. In the fourth season, straw incorporation followed by fertilizer application increased the recovery of fertilizer N to 0.43 kg N kg N-1 across management systems. Fertilizer N recovery was also significantly (P < 0.01) higher in SRI compared to RMP (a difference of 0.09 kg N kg N-1), driven by increased recovery in both -ST+F and +ST+F sub-treatments. In the fifth season, a significant management system x fertilizer interaction was observed (P < 0.05), with the recovery of fertilizer N in +ST+F plots reaching 0.64 kg N kg N-1 compared to 0.46 kg N kg N-1 in the -ST+F

ub-treatment in SRI. Conversely, no differences were found etween RMP sub-treatments, nor was the +ST+F sub-treatment in RI significantly higher than either fertilizer sub-treatment under MP.
.4. Partial nutrient balances and soil quality after five cropping easons
.4.1. Partial nutrient balances No significant main effects were found on partial macronutrint balances after five seasons of consecutive cropping. However, hen no fertilizer or straw was applied, highly negative balances ere found under both management systems for N, P and K (Fig. 5). n comparison, straw and fertilizer application each resulted in ignificant and positive N balances measured across management ystems (P < 0.001). Straw application had no effect on P balnces, while fertilizer addition had a small but significant impact P < 0.001), moving P balances towards the positive in RMP and SRI.
ith the exception of the +ST-F sub-treatment, K balances were onsistently negative, irrespective of management system. Relative o controls, highly significant differences were found for K under oth -ST+F and +F+ST sub-treatments (P < 0.001). Under both mangement systems, the negative balance was less severe under the atter treatment (+F+ST). Because SRI used less water during each eason (Table 3), RMP received on average more nutrients via irriation water than SRI over five seasons (72 vs. 46 kg N ha-1, 5 vs.
kg P ha-1 and 167 vs. 114 kg K ha-1). Precipitation imported an stimated 27 kg N, 0.08 kg P and 8 kg K ha-1 to both RMP and SRI lots over the course of five seasons (Fig. 5).
.4.2. Soil quality parameters No significant effects of crop management system, crop
anagement system x fertilizer application, crop manageent system x straw application, nor crop management ystem x fertilizer x straw application were found on soil total N r C, P-Olsen or exchangeable K after five seasons of continuous ropping (Table 6). But when measured across crop management ystems, straw incorporation significantly (P < 0.05) increased total
(with 17%), total C (with 15%) and exchangeable K (with 11%) ompared to non-fertilized (no fertilizer no straw) plots, respecively. Fertilizer application had a near-significant impact on vailable P (P = 0.054), increasing P-Olsen by 21% to 6.9 mg P kg-1. here were no significant differences in soil pH (range 4.7-6.7)
or EC (range 0.40-1.70 dS m-1) between management systems or sub-treatments, although when compared to baseline data taken in 2007 and measured across all plots, the final values for both pH and EC increased by 16% and 215% to means of 5.51 and 1.02 dS m-1 for both parameters (P < 0.001, data not shown).
4. Discussion
4.1. Yield, water savings and water productivity
Water savings ranging from 16%-48% were obtained under SRI in this study, resulting in increased water productivity compared to RMP. In only two of 20 observed cases SRI yields were significantly lower than in comparable RMP sub-treatments (under -ST-F and -ST+F in the 2009 wet season). But while SRI increased water savings and water productivity, no sustained yield or nutrient recovery advantages were found in comparison to any RMP sub-treatment.

Our results therefore indicate that while there is potential for water saving, farmers in the study region are unlikely to realize yield advantages with SRI compared to other improved crop management options when nutrient additions are held constant. This confirms McDonald et al. (2006, 2008), who suggested that SRI's yield benefits were likely to be limited when compared to an appropriate, upper-bound control system. Our results contrast with reports of high-yielding SRI performance in the Sahel where the SRI was compared to lower-bound farmers' practice controls alone, and with highly unequal nutrient additions (e.g. Styger et Al., 2010). Nonetheless, should farmers choose to experiment SRI to save water, our results show that they would be more likely to benefit over the long-term from combined organic matter (straw) and fertilizer application compared to mineral nutrient additions alone.

Reports of increased water productivity with SRI are common in field station experiments (e.g. Zhao Et Al., 2009). But under on-farm conditions, poor land leveling may increase the risk of submergence and plant loss in field depressions where farmers transplant only single, young seedlings and attempt to practice AWD (Krupnik et al., 2012). Similarly, higher field positions may not receive sufficient water and experience increased weed infestation (Rodenburg and Johnson, 2009). Caution should therefore be employed when extrapolating the results of this and other on-station studies to on-farm situations.

RMP) and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) under four fertility treatments ertilizer) in Ndiaye, Senegal. Because plots were rarely drained, drainage values fo ess than 5 kg ha-1 in total.

Ground water depths during the cropping season were generally etween -30 and -70 cm. SRI field water depths never exceeded 12 cm, above the maximum 15 cm depth for ``safe'' AWD with inimal risk of yield loss (Bouman et al., 2007). No correlations
etween water use and yield were observed, indicating that the oot zone in SRI plots was usually either moist or saturated, and hat drought stress was not encountered. Indeed, volumetric water ontent of soils under SRI was generally higher than 30% (data not hown), well above the permanent wilting point of 25% established or this soil by de Vries et al. (2010).

In landscapes with relatively shallow water tables, for examle in riverside depressions as in this study, or in large irrigation chemes with shallow water tables, Belder et al. (2004, 2005) sugested that water savings between 10% and 30% should be possible sing AWD with little yield penalty because rice roots can access ufficient soil moisture from capillary rise. Water-saving potential s also high on finely textured soils (Belder et al., 2007), such as hose in the current study site. Where soils are coarser, or fields re located in more isolated or higher-elevation irrigation schemes, aving water without reducing yield can be more difficult (Tabbal t al., 2002). In the 2009 dry season, very high water savings (48%) ere observed under SRI without significant yield loss compared to MP. Tuong et al. (1994) showed that small-plot experiments with ow bund to surface area ratios can result in unreasonably high eepage rates and exaggeration of estimated water requirements n flooded treatments. Though the bund to area ratio of sub-plots in his experiment was relatively small (0.7 m m-2), we maintain that

water savings are unlikely to have been overestimated because: (i) seepage was minimized by lining bunds with plastic sheeting and installing them into the soil below the plough layer, (ii) bund over-flow was never observed, and (iii) percolation in RMP was low. Also, (iv) evaporative losses are generally higher from ponded water compared to soil surfaces (Belder et al., 2005), and field water levels in SRI were below the surface for 54% of the time for this season. Thus, the water savings observed likely resulted from reduced seepage, careful irrigation in SRI, and higher evaporative floodwater losses from RMP.

The build-up of alkaline salts could also constrain yield in watersaving management systems in the Sahel (de Vries et al., 2010). In this experiment, soil EC increased dramatically after five seasons, confirming previous observations of the impact of double-cropping at the same site (Haefele et al., 2004). However, EC remained well below the threshold of 2.0 dS m-1 after which yield might be affected (Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000), and no differences were found between management systems. But because saline deposits are heterogeneously distributed (Ceuppens et al., 1997), further and longer-term research on the potential interaction between AWD irrigation and salinity should be undertaken.

Despite the water productivity advantages of SRI demonstrated in this study, it must be recognized that SRI is by no means the only method to save water without compromising yield. Evidence of good water savings in conventional management systems where AWD alone is implemented, but where crop establishment, weed and nutrient management remain relatively unchanged compared

o their flooded counterparts, is growing (e.g. Belder et Al., 2004, 005; Cabangon et Al., 2004; De Vries et Al., 2010). Sanjeewanie nd Ranamukharrachchi (2009) contrasted SRI with direct seeding sing AWD in Thailand. Both yield and water productivity were ighest with the latter system. Clearly, further research is needed to racket SRI's performance compared to other management options hat reduce water use.
.2. Recovery of straw and fertilizer nitrogen
Despite the potential for immobilization of fertilizer N when traw residues are incorporated, no negative effects on N uptake ere observed for either system during seasons 1-3 of this experment. In the fourth season, additive N-P-K uptake effects were ound for both crop management systems, but in the fifth and final eason, they were recorded only for SRI. It is not uncommon for sevral seasons to pass before straw incorporation positively affects ield in irrigated rice (Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2005). Delays may esult from the gradual build-up of soil nutrient pools with the susained addition of residues (e.g. Eagle et al., 2000), although when ompared to higher and more balanced mineral N-P-K rates, yield ncreases due to combined organic matter and fertilizer applicaions may not be significant (Dawe et al., 2003). In contrast, the ST+F sub-treatment affected macronutrient uptake more posiively with SRI than RMP in the current study. This suggests that esource-poor farmers unable to afford balanced N-P-K fertilizers ho experiment with SRI could gain from this fertility management trategy, although beneficial effects may only occur after several easons.

The additive SRI yield effects resulting from combined fertilizer nd straw application in the last two seasons of this study can be artially explained by improved recovery both of straw and fertilzer N. In the fourth season, straw N recovery was higher under ST+F compared to +ST-F (a difference of 17 kg ha-1 under SRI nd 7 kg ha-1 under RMP). SRI advocates argue that combined with WD, mechanical weeding aerates the soil and increases N minralization and supply to the crop (Ceesay, 2010; Uphoff et al., 010). However, the improved N uptake and recovery observed n this experiment is unlikely to have been caused by increased oil aeration. Despite the AWD regime, the soil water-status in SRI emained close to saturation. Moreover, volumetric water contents fter weeding tended to be higher than before, because irrigation ad to be introduced to facilitate the movement of rotary weeders. onversely, mechanical weeding may have stimulated mineralizaion by tearing straw into smaller pieces and increasing residue urface area exposed to microbial attack, though additional work is equired to confirm this hypothesis. The recovery of straw N in the ST+F sub-treatment was above 100% in the 2009 wet season, indiating that part of the recovered N was obtained from the labile oil N pool, which was probably augmented through the gradual ecycling of straw N incorporated over the previous four seasons. owever, while improved fertilizer N recovery under SRI has been eported elsewhere (Zhao et al., 2009), it was never statistically uperior to RMP in the current experiment.
.3. Long-term impact on macronutrient balances and soil quality
Both fertilizer and straw inputs, and grain and straw exports, xerted the largest effect on post-experiment partial macronutrient alances in this study. Fertilizer and straw application each posiively affected N balances. Rice straw contains little P, so P balances ere mainly increased by fertilizer alone. And although no fertilzer K was applied, both fertilizer and straw significantly impacted balances. Fertilizer N and P moved K balances towards the negaive because of increased crop growth and uptake of indigenous soil , although in all treatments soil exchangeable K remained above
earch 130 (2012) 155-167 165
the medium K status threshold of 0.45 cmol kg-1, below which fertilizer K might affect yield (Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000). Moreover, no treatment effects on grain or straw K concentrations were observed at harvest in the last season, and levels of each remained above deficiency thresholds according to Dobermann and Fairhurst (2000). But because straw contains large amounts of K, incorporation in +ST-F and +ST+F treatments helped to offset declining partial K balances.

While KCl fertilizer is recommended for double-cropping (Bado et al., 2010), high costs prohibit its use in the Sahel. Haefele et al. (2004) suggested that fertilizer K may not be necessary because equilibrium reactions between exchangeable and high total K reserves in West Africa's river floodplain soils could maintain levels above the critical limit for decades. While this is advantageous for resource-poor farmers unable to afford fertilizer K, we suggest that straw incorporation in double-cropped systems will help to offset losses, thereby prolonging depletion over longer periods of time, thus improving the long-term sustainability of rice cropping. Further research should be conducted to determine if recommended KCl application rates could be reduced where farmers incorporate rice straw, as reduced fertilizer K requirements would make KCl application more affordable, while also helping to maintain soil quality. Future studies should also examine in situ recycling of straw, as opposed to biomass importation as used in the current study. Finally, when measured at the conclusion of the experiment, straw incorporation led to small yet significant increases in total soil C and N compared to controls, arguably improving soil quality in each crop management system. Straw incorporation also supplies micronutrients (Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2005), which we were unable to examine in this study, potentially providing additional agronomic benefits.

Post-experiment estimates of partial macronutrient balances suggested slightly more positive trends for RMP compared to SRI, in part because of greater nutrient inputs through irrigation, although differences were never significant. But in water-saving systems more reliant on drainage, or where less irrigation is needed, differences could be larger. We estimated P and K concentrations in irrigation, rain and floodwater based on previous studies at the same location. Balances may therefore be slightly less accurate than desirable, although significant error is unlikely because concentrations fell within the bounds of the ranges reported in the literature (see Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000). Conversely, gaseous N losses, biological N fixation, leaching, inter-season capillary rise, and dry deposition also play a role in nutrient cycling (Cassman et al., 1998; Haefele, 2001), though we were unable to account for them in this study. Nutrient losses via leaching, however, are unlikely to be large in lowland rice fields (Cassman et al., 1998), especially where soils are finely textured and where water tables remain close to the soil surface. This study therefore provides a first-step towards estimating irrigation, wet deposition, and flood water drainage import and export pathways that are typically not included in partial nutrient balance studies. Additional work is needed to quantify the gaps described above, especially in double-cropped, water-saving rice systems, where import and export pathways could significantly differ.
5. Conclusion
We investigated the potential for water savings and the impact of organic (straw) and inorganic soil fertility amendments on yields and nutrient balances under Recommended Management Practices and the System of Rice Intensification over five seasons in the Senegal River Delta. Our results indicate that substantial water savings and increases in water productivity can be obtained with SRI, although significant yield increases compared to RMP should

ot be expected. Positive effects resulting from straw incorporation ollowed by fertilizer application became apparent in the fourth eason as significant additive increases in yield, straw and fertilizer
recovery were observed under both RMP and SRI. However, coninuation of these trends was only observed for SRI in the fifth and nal season of the experiment, suggesting that integrated organic nd mineral nutrient management of soil fertility is more advanageous with SRI than RMP. Fertilizer and straw additions also had
positive effect on partial macronutrient balances and soil qualty parameters. Further work should be conducted to investigate he mechanisms underlying these results, and to compare SRI's ield and water productivity performance to other water-saving ice management systems. If farmers in the Sahel practicing doubleropping choose to experiment with techniques like SRI to reduce ater use and thus input costs, our findings indicate that they are ost likely to benefit over time by practicing straw residue incororation followed by mineral fertilizer additions, although when utrient additions are held equal, SRI is unlikely to improve yield rends over long-established Recommended Management Pracices.

Life Cycle Thinking for the environmental and financial assessment of rice management systems in the Senegal River Valley .

Rice is a staple food in Senegal, which however imports more than 70% of the rice consumed annually to meet its domestic demand. Despite governmental efforts to increase rice self-sufficiency, both rice supply and yields remain low. Senegalese farmers face challenges related to irrigation infrastructure and fertiliser access, besides those derived from climate change. This study applies Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) combined with financial Life Cycle Costing (LCC) to evaluate alternative scenarios for rice management in the Senegal River Valley and identify sustainability hotspots and potential improvements. Specifically, rice cultivation in Ross Bethio (Saint Louis, Senegal) is assessed based on the observed agricultural practices during the dry seasons of 2016 and 2017. Two scenarios capturing conventional (CONV) and intensive (INT) practices are compared to two reference scenarios (SAED scenarios) according to the recommendations of the official agricultural advisory service. The INT scenario generates the lowest impacts per kg of paddy rice in seven out of thirteen impact categories, including climate change, freshwater and marine eutrophication, ozone depletion and water scarcity. This is due to the higher yields (7.4 t ha 1) relative to CONV (4.8 t ha 1) and the two reference SAED scenarios (6.0 t ha 1). The two latter scenarios show the lowest values in the remaining categories, although they also generate slightly lower profits than INT (138 euro t 1 vs. 149 euro t 1) due to increased labour costs for additional fertilisation treatments. The results from both LCA and LCC underline the importance of increasing yields to decrease environmental impacts and production costs of rice when estimated per kg of product. Well-designed fertiliser application doses and timing and increased mechanisation can deliver further environmental benefits. Additional improvements (e.g. in irrigation, crop rotations, straw management) could be considered to promote the longterm sustainability and profitability of rice production in Senegal. LCA in combination with financial LCC is identified as a decision-support tool for evaluating the sustainability of alternative crop management practices.

support and capacity building are increasingly demanded to boost domestic rice supply and ensure both food availability and access across Sub-Saharan Africa (Africa Rice Center, 2011; Nhamo et al., 2014; Nwilene et al., 2008). However, a shift towards more integrated rice management is needed to contribute to a broader food security concept, increasing crop yields and agricultural sustainability (West et al., 2014). Promoting a sustainable food security challenges both governments and the research community to think beyond increasing food supply (Grote, 2014; Ingram, 2011). Thus, improving rice productivity and sustainability becomes strategic for African countries to meet their 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as it can simultaneously reduce poverty and hunger (SDG1 and SDG2), while promoting growth and employment (SDG8) and more sustainable production and consumption (SDG12).

Senegal is the third-largest rice importer in Africa after Nigeria and South Africa (FAOSTAT, 2021). Rice consumption represents around 31% of the calorie intake in Senegal, though domestic rice production only covers about 28% of the country's requirements, challenging food security (Diagne et al., 2013; FAO, 2010; Puma et al., 2015). The Senegalese government has been launching several strategies to stimulate domestic production, such as the national programme for rice self-sufficiency (PNAR). This was intended to increase total rice supply up to one million tonnes by 2012, by promoting the expansion of cultivated areas, investment in mechanisation and processing technologies, and the professionalisation of supply chain actors (MAER, 2021). The overall goal was not achieved, with around 470,000 tonnes produced in that very year (FAOSTAT, 2021). The second PNAR established new agricultural policies for the period 2014-2017, increasing rice production by more than twofold relative to 2012, i.e. at 1,011,269 tonnes by the end of the period (FAOSTAT, 2021). Average yields however decreased from 4.1 t ha- 1 to 3.3 t ha- 1 in that period, and have remained highly variable, though still higher than those in other Western African countries (FAOSTAT, 2021). Climate change is expected to negatively impact rice productivity in West Africa through droughts and higher temperatures (Van Oort and Zwart, 2018; Wassmann et al., 2009). Further institutional measures that promote technological innovation and more sustainable agricultural practices are needed to counteract these effects and secure rice availability in Senegal (Diagne et al., 2013; Krupnik et al., 2012).

The Senegal River Valley (SRV), located in the Sahel zone, is one of the major irrigated rice-producing areas in Senegal and the whole Africa (Van Oort and Zwart, 2018). In Senegal, rice is also produced in the Southern region of Casamance, although only the SRV diverts part of its rice production to other regional markets (USDA-GAIN, 2018). The favourable climate conditions and the adoption of varieties with shorter cropping cycles allow for two rice harvests per year, namely in the dry and rainy seasons (Van Oort et al., 2016). In the SRV, production areas are typically larger in the dry season, which brings fewer problems with pests and birds (Tanaka et al., 2015; USDA-GAIN, 2018). Average yields in SRV theoretically range between 5.0 and 6.0 t ha- 1 in the rainy season and between 6.5 and 7.5 t ha- 1 in the dry season (SAED, 2019; USDA-GAIN, 2021). Irrigated rice cultivation is particularly intensive in the use of water, posing technological challenges and ecological problems in regions vulnerable to climate change, in addition to financial burdens for small-scale and resource-poor farmers (Diagne et al., 2013; Krupnik et al., 2012; Venema and Schiller, 1995). Investment in more efficient irrigation systems is desirable to help mitigate the risks of drought and ensure a stable rice supply and associated revenues throughout the year (Paglietti and Machado-Mendes, 2016). Farmers face additional hurdles such as breakdown of fertiliser supply or lack of machinery; hence, inputs are often not conveniently applied regarding dates and doses (Diagne et al., 2013). Optimising agricultural practices by taking all these aspects into account is of paramount importance to improve the sustainability of rice cultivation in the SRV under resource constraints.

Rice production is a resource- and emission-intensive activity,
causing environmental impacts both at regional and global scales, such as water depletion, land occupation, or global warming (Sporchia et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). Rice production is responsible for approximately 11% of the global anthropogenic CH4 emissions, the most significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions among food crops (Jiang et al., 2019). Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) has been proposed as a multi-dimensional framework to reduce impacts from production and consumption from a supply chain perspective, that is, by considering all processes from raw materials extraction to disposal (Guinee et al., 2011; Sonnemann et al., 2018). As for the environmental dimension, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) applies LCT to quantify several impacts in terms of ecosystems damage, resource depletion, and human health. Life Cycle Costing (LCC) assesses the economic performance of production systems, often as costs and profits, and can be applied in combination with LCA to quantify impact abatement costs of alternative production technologies or decisions (Escobar et al., 2015; Fenollosa et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2009). Financial LCC considers all the activities that represent either direct costs to the decision-maker or make them a profit during the economic life of the investment, i.e. all the costs of fulfilling the functional unit (FU), including production, operation and disposal (Carlsson Reich, 2005; Lichtenvort et al., 2008). While the costs of environmental externalities could also be estimated, this requires the application of additional methodologies or principles. In general, only those costs that are likely to be covered by actors in the product system and within the decision-relevant timeframe should be monetised (Swarr et al., 2011). The application of LCA and financial LCC provides valuable information on the sustainability trade-offs of alternative scenarios. Yet, the number of studies that combine LCC with LCA to evaluate rice production systems is relatively limited (Arunrat et al., 2016; Jirapornvaree et al., 2021; Saber et al., 2020; Thanawong et al., 2014).

Many LCA studies focus on the environmental performance of rice cultivation, considering alternative crop management options (Bacenetti et al., 2016; Fusi et al., 2014; Harun et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2020). Nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from fertilisers application are a major contributor to eutrophication and acidification impacts associated with rice production; while also being a cause of climate change together with CH4 emissions from flooded fields (Bacenetti et al., 2016; Hayashi et al., 2016; Thanawong et al., 2014). Hence, improving fertiliser management is crucial to simultaneously decrease impacts of climate change, acidification and freshwater eutrophication (Wang et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2013, 2020). Water scarcity impacts of rice have been less sistematically examined, as a broader consensus on the characterisation methods to be applied has only recently been reached (Boulay et al., 2018; Jolliet et al., 2018; Nunez et al., 2016). Similarly, ecosystems and human toxicity impacts have been frequently neglected in LCAs of agricultural products due to the lack of agreement on both the framework for modelling primary emissions from pesticides and characterisation factors for all chemicals involved (Fantke et al., 2018; Pena et al., 2019; Rosenbaum et al., 2015). This underlines the importance of adequately selecting the methods to estimate on-field emissions, especially for reactive N from fertilisers (e.g. NH3 or N2O). LCAs mostly rely on the Tier 1 approach of the IPCC (2006) guidelines, which provide default emission factors (EFs) that do not consider the influence of climate, soil characteristics, type of fertiliser and time of application or the irrigation system (Brodt et al., 2014; Cayuela et al., 2017). Perrin et al. (2014) recommend performing soil N balances combined with mechanistic and dynamic models to develop generic tools for calculating N-related emissions from agri-food production. Although data-intensive, mechanistic models are suitable tools for quantifying on-field emissions when fertiliser application is relevant for the LCA study (Andrade et al., 2021).

Improving the environmental and economic performances of rice production in the SRV is key to increase food self-sufficiency in Senegal, given the contribution of the region to the domestic rice supply. This study aims to evaluate observed and recommended rice cultivation practices in the municipality of Ross Bethio (Saint Louis, Senegal),

located in the SRV, to identify sustainability hotspots and suggest improvements. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first case study that combines LCA and financial LCC for the sustainability assessment of rice production in an African context. This study is the result of a 2-year research project (AD1511-UPV) funded by the Centre for Development Cooperation of the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Spain), carried out jointly with Caritas Spain and Caritas Senegal in 2016-2017. The project's goal was to improve rice production in Ross Bethio by increasing yields and economic profits while decreasing environmental impacts, in order to promote rural development and a sustainable food security in the region.

2. Methods .

2.1. Life cycle assessment .

2.1.1. Goal and scope definition .

The goal of the LCA is to quantify the environmental and economic impacts of rice cultivation in Ross Bethio (Senegal), based on the agricultural practices applied by the Union of Women Rice Producers (UFPRRB, according to the French acronym) during the dry seasons of 2016 and 2017. The observed practices are compared to those reference practices recommended by the Society for the Management and Exploitation of the Senegal River Delta (SAED, according to the French acronym). SAED is a governmental organisation that promotes irrigated agriculture on the left margin of both the Senegal and Faleme rivers.

Ross Bethio is a municipality in the Dagana Department, in the North-Western region of Saint Louis. It is located 47 m above sea level, near the mouth of the Senegal River, where this provides water for rice irrigation. Until recently, the propagation of tidal variations in water level over large distances and the saline water intrusion into the river generated a vast area with weakly drained halomorphic soils (Isupova and Mikhailov, 2008). However, the hydrological regime of the Senegal River mouth area radically changed in 1986 after the Diama dam was built, forming an obstacle to both the upstream flow of seawater and tidal level variations. Despite the good quality of the water, soil salinity became a limiting factor for rice production in the area of study, negatively affecting rice yields.

The Saint Louis region has a tropical climate with an average low temperature above 18 oC throughout the year, which allows for two rice harvests per year. These correspond to the dry season (from February/ March to June/July) and the rainy season (from July to November). The annual reference evapotranspiration is greater than 2500 mm (Ndiaye et al., 2020). Table 1 shows the climatic conditions in Ross Bethio (world weather online, 2021). The most important edaphic characteristics measured in the plots at the beginning of the project (2016) are included in Table 2. The high soil salinity stands out, as well as its variability depending on the location of the plot.

The UFPRRB is responsible for 130 ha in total, handed over by the national government. Women are organised by simple agreement in groups of at least two people (either legal or physical), i.e. the so-called economic interest groups (GIE, according to the French acronym). GIEs do not have the obligation of initial capital and are flexible organisations from the legal point of view, which allows the most modest initiatives to be organised and access credit (Tarriere Diop, 1995). The UFPRRB consists of 28 GIEs and each producer receives 1 ha. Typically, those plots cultivated in the rainy season lay fallow in the next dry season and vice-versa. Specifically, in the dry season of 2016, Caritas funded the cultivation of 30 ha corresponding to seven GIEs; whereas, in 2017, the overall area managed by the NGO was 15 ha. It must be noted that rice production is only assessed in these two successive dry seasons, as the crop failed in the corresponding rainy seasons due to technical problems. In April 2016, the main irrigation canal was completely dry for twelve days, exactly when plants' panicles were at the initiation stage, allowing rodents to invade the plots and suck the sap. As a result, there was hardly any rice production in the rainy season of 2016. In 2017, Caritas Spain's auditors decided to withdraw the project arguing that Ross Bethio had reached an acceptable level of development. The NGO thus reallocated the funds to a one-year project in Podor, Senegal's northernmost town, on the border with Mauritania.

The primary goal of rice production in Ross Bethio is to provide food for both self-consumption and for other regional markets, contributing to food availability (see section 1). Therefore, the FU is defined under a productive scope as 1 kg of paddy rice (with 20-24% moisture). The system boundaries include all processes involved in rice production from cradle to farm gate, i.e. before drying (Fig. 1). These refer to the following processes: the production of seeds, fertilisers, and herbicides; transport of agricultural inputs to the farms; diesel production for the irrigation pump and agricultural machinery; and on-field emissions from input application. Upstream machinery production is excluded, as machinery operations are outsourced, implying intensive use and low environmental impacts per FU.

2.1.2. Description of scenarios .

Two scenarios are defined describing the actual agricultural practices implemented by UFPRRB farmers, based on surveys conducted in 2016 and 2017 (Table 3). The first scenario is referred to as conventional (CONV) as it reflects the average practices of the GIEs through the period of study (30 ha in 2016; 9 ha in 2017). The second scenario, intensive (INT), corresponds to the more intensive practices applied in 2017 by a group of farmers with 6 ha in total, where both the seed and fertiliser doses were increased. Moreover, two additional ex-ante scenarios according to the recommendations of the official agricultural advisory service of the SRV (SAED, 2009a,b) are taken as reference, namely SAED_2td and SAED_3td, which mainly differ in terms of fertiliser doses and number of top-dressing applications. These two scenarios were not implemented in practice but represent theoretical alternatives that are also feasible for SRV farmers, taking into account the availability of fertilisers in the region and other resource constraints. Table 3 summarises the quantity and type of inputs used in each scenario, agricultural practices, and associated yields. Table 4 shows the underlying

amount of nutrients applied per scenario. Soil preparation is the same in all scenarios. Before sowing, deep tillage is carried out every three years with a mouldboard plough coupled to a tractor. Additionally, two weeks before sowing, a shallow tillage (10-15 cm) is made, with a disc plough followed by land levelling to improve water management and weed control. Furthermore, irrigation channels are manually cleaned and repaired at the beginning of every season.

In all scenarios, seeds of the rice variety Sahel 108 are sown, a shortcycle variety (around 125 days) especially developed by the International Rice Research Institute to succeed under extreme conditions in the African Sahel. The major disadvantage of this variety is that it is not tolerant to salinity. Seeds are pre-germinated by soaking the seed sacks and then burying them in the ground for 24 h. Broadcast seeding is carried out by hand on irrigated plots with a 2-5 cm depth sheet of water. After sowing, fields should be periodically irrigated to hold a sheet of water of 5 cm during the vegetative phase (around 55 days). At the beginning of the reproductive phase, the water table is increased to 10 cm; then, it remains until two weeks after blossom, that is, another 55 days. Although this is the standard practice, the water table was not always maintained at the desired level, which explains the high presence of weeds observed in most plots.

As for weed control, herbicides are applied with a knapsack sprayer. The active ingredients and the corresponding doses are shown in Table 3. Following SAED's recommendations, herbicide treatment in all the scenarios consists first in spreading Bensulfuron-methyl (CAS RN 83055-99-6) on the flooded soil around six days after sowing. Propanil (CAS RN 709-98-8) and 2,4-D (CAS RN 94-75-7) are applied three weeks after sowing, after draining the soil. The plots are irrigated between 48 and 72 h later.

UFPRRB farmers do not perform a basic dressing, arguing that this later leads to more weeds. Hence, only two top dressings are applied in the CONV scenario (see Table 3): the first one with urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP) at the beginning of tillering; and the second only with urea at panicle initiation. In INT, a basic dressing is firstly applied with urea and DAP, followed by two top-dressing applications with urea. SAED_2td and SAED_3td scenarios are similar to CONV in terms of fertiliser doses, but the former use DAP for basic fertilisation and urea for top dressing. The difference between SAED_2td and SAED_3td is that urea is fractionated in two and three applications, respectively.

When rice ripening begins, plots are drained and, two weeks later, rice is harvested. In CONV and INT scenarios, rice is harvested by hand, with the help of an animal-drawn thresher. In this case, a service provider organizes a group of 6-8 workers, who harvest 2 ha per working day. Yields are estimated by each GIE based on the number of sacks obtained by each farmer and their corresponding average weight (80 kg rice per sack). Sacks that are not full are weighed in situ. At the end of the cropping season, the UFPRRB farmers reported average yields for the two seasons assessed of 4832 kg ha- 1 and 7425 kg ha- 1 for the areas under CONV and INT management, respectively. The theoretical yield in the two SAED scenarios is taken from the technical data sheet (SAED, 2009a, b). This is 6000 kg ha- 1 assuming compliance with the input application doses and timing. SAED also recommends the use of a combine harvester for harvesting rice, which can contribute to increased productivity. Since the GIE's farmers have the possibility to outsource the use of this technology, it was considered that the two SAED scenarios employ a combine harvester with an estimated diesel consumption of 12 L ha- 1. While manual harvesting covers 2 ha per day, the combine harvester harvests approximately 5 ha every day, reducing labour costs.

The rice straw is commonly lefton the field to feed free-roaming cattle; therefore, no allocation is made between paddy rice and straw in any scenario, as the latter has no economic value.

2.1.3. Inventory data collection .

In the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) phase, several data sources were used and assumptions were made to collect data on environmentally relevant inputs and outputs from cradle to farm gate, as follows:
Agricultural inputs. Primary data on crop management and agricultural input intensity in scenarios CONV and INT were collected from surveys to UFPRRB farmers and interviews with Caritas' technicians. These data cover all agricultural practices, from soil preparation before sowing to rice harvesting. For the SAED scenarios, agricultural inputs and doses were in line with SAED's recommendations (SAED, 2009a,b), as specified above.

Emissions from fertilisers application. N losses from fertiliser application (as N2O and NH3 emissions to air and NO3
- leached to groundwater) and N emission responses to soil and water management were estimated with LEACHN, the N module of the LEACHM model (Hutson and Wagenet, 1992). This a mechanistic, one-dimensional, and dynamic
method in line with IPCC's Tier 3 approach, which estimates losses of ammonium, urea and nitrate by lixiviation; ammonium losses by volatilisation; and nitrate losses by denitrification. To simulate N dynamics, LEACHN models water and solute movement, as well as related chemical and biological processes in the unsaturated soil. Water and nutrient fluxes are estimated by numerical integration of the Richards' equation and the convection-dispersion equation for solute transport. Both equations can be applied to unsaturated as well as saturated soils (Hutson and Wagenet, 1992). N fluxes among compartments are simulated with first order kinetics for the N dynamics (Hutson and Wagenet, 1991). LEACHN considers three organic pools (manure, litter, and a relatively stable humus fraction) and three mineral pools (urea, ammonium, and nitrate) for N cycling. Thus, LEACHN offers advantages over IPCC's Tier 1 approach, as the former captures the influence of soil and climate conditions, together with water and N fertiliser management, on N-related emissions and the subsequent environmental impacts.

As for data requirements, LEACHN is based on actual data on N inputs through rainwater and irrigation, fertilisation and organic amendments. Nitrification, volatilisation, and denitrification rates specific for flooded rice soils were taken from Chowdary et al. (2004). Additional data on soil, irrigation and crop characteristics were obtained experimentally from one selected plot during the 2017 dry season, corresponding to the CONV scenario. In this plot, soil samples were taken before sowing at 15 cm intervals down to 30 cm (Table 5). The amount of water applied per watering in the plot was estimated by measuring the rise in the water table. Additionally, meteorological data (daily rainfall, maximum and minimum air temperature) for the seasons of study were taken from Accuweather (2017). The meteorological station in Diobene (Thies, Senegal) was considered, as the closest one for which daily data were available. Reference evapotranspiration was estimated from the daily maximum and minimum air temperature using the Hargreaves method (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). The hydraulic parameters of the model were estimated from the SPAW software (Saxton and Rawls, 2006) by using data on soil texture and organic carbon content from the soil analysis (see Table 5). The LEACHN model was calibrated by adjusting water infiltration and drainage according to the meteorological parameters indicated. The calibrated model was then applied to the remaining scenarios by considering the same climatic data and irrigation frequency as in CONV but varying the fertiliser application doses.

In addition to N emissions, CO2 emissions from urea application were calculated under the Tier 1 approach of the IPCC (2006) guidelines. Emissions from phosphorus application, namely phosphate (PO4
3- ) to both groundwater and surface water, were calculated according to Nemecek et al. (2014). Specifically, an average P leaching of 0.07 kg ha- 1 year- 1 and run-off of 0.175 kg ha- 1 year- 1 was taken into account for arable land.

Methane emissions. Anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in flooded rice paddies produces CH4, which is released to the atmosphere primarily by transport through the rice plants (IPCC, 2019). As Tier 2 EFs for CH4 emissions specific for African countries are not available (Boateng et al., 2017), these emissions were estimated under the Tier 1 approach (IPCC, 2006), considering the revised EFs (IPCC, 2019). The following assumptions were taken: the plots are drained before the second herbicide treatment during a period shorter than three days; fields are left in fallow prior to the crop establishment, with a non-flooded pre-season longer than 180 days; and no organic matter is added.

Pesticide emissions. To estimate emissions from herbicides application, the PestLCI Consensus model v1.0 was used (Fantke et al., 2017a, b). This model departs from the original pesticide emission model PestLCI (Birkved and Hauschild, 2006; Dijkman et al., 2012). It has been further developed and parametrised to represent different crop types (including paddy rice), plant growth stages, drift deposition curves, and pesticide application methods.

N. Escobar et al.

Journal of Environmental Management 310 (2022) 114722
The primary distribution of herbicides was modelled for each scenario with the PestLCI web-tool (https://pestlciweb.man.dtu.dk/), covering the initial processes within a few minutes after application. This allowed estimating both on-field and off-field emissions in the three environmental compartments, i.e. air, water and agricultural soil. Offfield herbicide emissions (i.e. drift fraction deposited in off-field surfaces) were further distributed among the environmental compartments using the water-to-soil area ratio for Senegal. A ratio of 0.02 was estimated based on soil and land cover data at the country level (BGS, 2019; Furian et al., 2011).

The emission fractions linked to the use of herbicides are based on the respective contents of active ingredient (a.i.) and the respective application doses indicated by UFPRRB farmers and SAED recommendations. The growth stage of the plants during pesticide application was considered in combination with the BBCH-scale to determine the leaf area index, and hence, the fractions intercepted by the leaves. The BBCH-scale describes the phenological development stage for different plants, including rice. As for data requirements, the web-tool available for the PestLCI Consensus model uses actual data on pesticide treatments, considering the effect of tillage, pesticide application method, presence of buffer zones, and edaphoclimatic characteristics, among other factors.

Irrigation water. Due to lack of records, irrigation water had to be estimated in a representative plot during the dry season of 2017, based on the number of waterings made, their duration, and the pump's flow rate. The average dose of water per season was calculated at 17,600 m3 ha- 1, although it can vary depending on the specific soil characteristics of the plot. The consumptive part of the irrigation water withdrawal was estimated based on the crop evapotranspiration.

Background processes. For the background LCI data, both Ecoinvent 3.6 (Wernet Et Al., 2016) and GaBi databases (Sphera Solutions GmbH, 2021) were used - see table S1 in the electronic supplementary material (ESM). Default processes from Ecoinvent v3.6 were chosen to include energy production, fertiliser and herbicides manufacturing, seed production and transport processes, considering cut-off system modelling. For herbicides production, Acetamide-anilide and Sulfonyl-urea compounds were respectively considered as substitutes for propanil and bensulfuron-methyl, which belong to the same chemical group but are not included in the database. Processes on machinery operations - i. e. tractor, combine harvester and irrigation pump -, were taken from the GaBi database. Emissions from both tractor and combine harvester were calculated by adjusting default processes based on primary data on fuel consumption (L ha- 1) and time (h ha- 1) needed for tillage and harvest operations, respectively.

2.1.4. Impact assessment .

The ReCiPe method (Huijbregts et al., 2016) was chosen for the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) at the midpoint level. The following impact categories were selected for being critical for the environmental assessment of agricultural systems such as rice, which are intensive in the use of fertilisers and other resources including water: climate change (CC), as CO2-eq. for a 100-year time horizon (kg); metal depletion (MD), as Cu-eq. (kg); fossil depletion (FD), as oil-eq. (kg); terrestrial acidification (TA), as SO2-eq. (kg); freshwater eutrophication (FwEU), as P-EQ. (kg), marine eutrophication (meu), as N-EQ. (kg); Ozone depletion (OD), as CFC-11-eq. (kg); and photochemical ozone formation for humans (POF-HH) and ecosystems (POF-Ec), both as NOx-eq (kg). Toxicity
impacts, namely freshwater ecotoxicity (FwEtx), human toxicity - carcinogenic (Htx-C), and human toxicity - non-carcinogenic (Htx-NC), are quantified with the USEtox 2.0 model (Fantke et al., 2017a,b) and expressed as mass-based comparative toxic quantities for ecosystems and human health, i.e. CTUe and CTUh, respectively. These, in turn, represent an estimate of the potentially affected fraction of species and human toxicity cases, respectively, integrated over time and volume, per unit of mass of chemical emitted. Finally, the AWARE 1.2C (Boulay et al., 2018) method is employed to assess the impact of blue water scarcity (WS). Under this approach, high characterisation factors for unspecified water are chosen, yielding User Deprivation Potential (UDP) in m3 world-eq.

2.2. Financial life cycle costing .

Different approaches can be taken to carry our an LCC (Ciroth et al., 2008; Lichtenvort et al., 2008). In the present study, the economic performance is assessed through a financial LCC in which the economic value is strictly determined by the internal costs generated along the life cycle. LCC always implies the perspective of an economic agent that acts as a decision-maker (Norris, 2001). In this case, farmers are the decision-makers, who do not bear the costs of environmental pollution. Hence, further externalities from environmental impacts are not taken into account. This financial LCC consists in quantifying life cycle costs, revenues and profits per FU, from cradle to farm gate, consistent with the LCA system boundaries. Total costs were thus calculated based on the management practices and inputs applied by the UFPRRB farmers (Table 3). Specifically, the costs of rice cultivation arise from soil preparation, sowing, watering, pesticide and fertiliser application, and harvesting. As shown in Table 6, production costs include labour, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds, sacks for the harvested rice, water, and machinery use; while depreciation is excluded as machinery operations are outsourced. The respective data were gathered through the above-mentioned interviews, while prices of inputs were gathered from
N. Escobar et al.

Journal of Environmental Management 310 (2022) 114722
the UFPRRB suppliers. This allowed generating a cost-sheet database reflecting both the management practices and the products and services involved in each case.

As can be seen in Table 6, the watering costs consist of a fixed annual fee plus the costs of diesel consumed by the pump and labour. It should also be noted that outsourcing the combine harvester has the same cost per ha (76.20 euro ha- 1) as harvesting by hand (152 euro day- 1) since, on average, the group of workers harvests 2 ha per day.

Revenues were calculated as the yield multiplied by the average selling price of paddy rice in 2016-2017 as provided by the UFPRRB, i.e. 130 CFA francs per kg. It must be noted that, on average, around 50% of the total paddy rice production is used for self-consumption, according to the surveys among UFPRRB members. Therefore, to calculate the profits, the effect of self-consumption was included as avoided (negative) costs (i.e. by not buying white rice instead), considering that 1 kg of paddy rice yields 0.63 kg of white rice (FAO, 1992). The average retail price of white rice (270 CFA kg- 1) was taken from the Senegalese Office of the Food Security Commissioner (Comissariat a la Securite Alimentaire, 2017). Finally, the profits obtained by the farmer were calculated as the difference between the revenues and total costs. Costs, revenues, and profits are expressed in euro by considering the 2018 average exchange rate (1 euro = 655.9890 CFA).

3. Results .

3.1. On-field emissions .

The calculated on-field agricultural emissions per hectare in each scenario are shown in Table 7. CH4 emissions from anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in flooded paddy fields constitute the largest source of GHG emissions (as CO2-eq.), followed by N2O and CO2 emissions from urea application. All scenarios generate the same amount of CH4 per hectare, as this depends on the management practices (irrigation and straw management), which are the same across scenarios. Due to differences in yields, CH4 emissions per kg of rice are estimated at 2.7 10- 3 kg in CONV, 1.7 10- 3 kg in INT and 1.8 10- 3 kg in the two SAED scenarios. These respectively represent 46%, 41% and 44% of the total on-field GHG emissions per FU. On the contrary, direct CO2 emissions make the smallest contribution to on-field GHG emissions (as CO2-eq.) per FU, i.e. between 3% in the two SAED scenarios and 4.5% in INT. This is mainly due to the higher dose of urea applied in the latter (see Tables 3 and 4), which yields the highest CO2 emissions per hectare among all scenarios (see Table 7). When expressed per kg of rice, CO2 emissions are similar in CONV and INT scenarios, at around 5.0 10- 2 kg each. The lowest values are obtained for SAED_2td and SAED_3td, at around 3.7 10- 2 kg CO2, respectively.

N2O emissions make a significant contribution to total on-field GHG emissions. These are determined by the amount of N supplied per hectare, but also by the number of applications, same as any N-related emissions. N2O emissions per hectare are 26% higher in INT than in CONV mainly due to the effect of the residual mineral N that remained in the soil after the previous crop. Intensive fertilisation often increases the residual N, which causes emissions from N volatilisation in the next cropping season. In int, ca. 10% of the N applied to the previous crop remained in the soil, whereas in the other scenarios all mineral N was previously absorbed by the plants. Indeed, LEACHN estimates that approximately 70% of denitrification and leaching losses in INT take place during the first 15 days after sowing. SAED_2td and SAED_3td deliver 11% and 8% lower N2O emissions than CONV; due to the lower N doses and because top dressing is split into two and three applications, respectively. When expressed per FU, all scenarios generate N2O emissions in similar amounts, i.e. around 2.0 10- 3 kg per kg of paddy rice. This implies 39%, 44%, 42% and 41% of total on-field GHG emissions (as kg CO2-eq.) In int, conv, SAED_2td and SAED_3td scenarios, respectively.

As for the remaining N emissions, INT generates 36% higher NH3
emissions from ammonia volatilisation than CONV, when estimated per hectare. Lower urea application doses translate into 13% lower NH3 emissions in SAED_2td; and 24% lower in SAED_3td, where the same urea dose is split into three applications. As observed for N2O emissions, CONV and INT scenarios generate NH3 emissions in similar amounts per kg of paddy rice (1.2 10- 2 and 1.1 10- 2 kg, respectively), whereas the lowest values are obtained for SAED_2td (8.4 10- 3 kg) and SAED_3td (7.3 10- 3 kg). NO3
- emissions to water per hectare are the highest in INT, followed by the two SAED scenarios and CONV. This is related to the higher leaching rates estimated by LEACHN in INT at the beginning of the cropping season, due to residual NO3
- . In INT, basic dressing also contributes to increased NO3
- losses, as more N is readily available in the soil. When estimated per kg of rice, CONV generates the highest NH3 emissions (8.9 10- 3 kg) and INT the lowest (6.6 10- 3 kg).

PO4 3- emissions to water are the same in all scenarios (0.8 kg ha- 1) (Table 7). This is because the model employed to estimate these emissions (Nemecek et al., 2014) does not take into account the P2O5 dose applied, which is still the same across scenarios in this case study (Table 4). This is, in turn, due to the fact that soluble inorganic forms of P are strongly adsorbed by mineral surfaces or precipitate, making the dose irrelevant. When estimated per Fu, int delivers the lowest value (1.1 10- 4 kg), followed by SAED_2td and SAED_3td (1.4 10- 4 kg) and conv (1.7 10- 4 kg).

All scenarios generate the same amount of pesticide emissions per hectare, as the same treatments were applied per scenario (see Table 3). From primary distribution, pesticide emissions are mainly deposited in the soil. Emissions to air are fixed values subject to the application method, which was a knapsack sprayer in all cases. Hence, airborne emissions are 5% of the applied dose in all scenarios. Pesticide emissions to water represent 20% of the off-field emissions, while the remaining 80% are emissions to soil. The CONV scenario is associated with the highest values for all pesticide emissions per FU, while the lowest are estimated in INT. This is due to yield differences, as the herbicide treatment was the same in all scenarios.

3.2. Environmental impact results .

The CONV scenario generates the greatest environmental impacts per FU across all impact categories, as shown in Table 8. This is mainly due to the lower average yield obtained in the 2016 and 2017 dry seasons, relative to the other three scenarios. The yield in INT is 54% higher than in CONV, which offsets the effect of the higher input intensity (e.g. 38.5% greater N application and 25% greater seeding rate), decreasing the values across impact categories relative to the latter scenario. Theoretical yields estimated in SAED_2td and SAED_3td are 24.2% higher than those in CONV, while the N supply is 12.8% lower, which also explains the lower impact values in the former scenarios. INT causes greater impact reductions - relative to CONV - than both SAED scenarios in CC, FwEU, MEU, OD, POF-Ec, POF-HH and WS, where the effect of yield prevails (see Table 8). On the contrary, SAED_2td and SAED_3td cause greater impact reductions than INT in FD, MD, TA, due to the lower doses of fertilisers applied; and in FwEtx, Htx-C and Htx-NC due to the slightly lower toxicity associated with the production and transport of fertilisers in comparison with INT; while the dose of pesticides applied is the same. Impact reductions with respect to CONV vary from 10.6% in OD in SAED_2td to 32.1% in POF-HH in INT. SAED_3td yields greater environmental impact reductions than SAED_2td in those impact categories where on-field N emissions from fertilisers are relevant due to the positive effect of fractioning the application of topdressing fertiliser.

The analysis of the relative contribution of each emission source to the overall life cycle impacts shows similar patterns in all scenarios, as shown in Fig. 2. It should be noted that Fig. 2 shows total human toxicity (Htx) results as the sum of Htx-C and Htx-NC. On-field emissions from fertilisers make the greatest contribution to CC, FwEU, MEU, OD, and TA. Specifically, on-field emissions account for 98% of OD due to N2O

emissions; and for more than 80% of MEU and TA, regardless of the scenario, due to NH3, NO3 - and PO4 3- . The contribution of these emissions to FwEU is around 50%, with the largest share observed in the two SAED scenarios, i.e. 56%. On-field emissions are responsible for more than 75% of CC due to CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions, e.g. 76% in INT and 79% in both SAED_2td and SAED_3td.

The production of fertilisers is a significant source of impacts due to the consumption of energy and mineral resources, with the subsequent emissions. This sub-stage accounts for >20% of the impacts of FD, FwEU, FwEtx, Htx-C, and MD across scenarios. This share is consistently larger in INT than in the other scenarios, as the amount of fertilisers applied per FU is greater. As expected, WS is mainly associated with irrigation, causing 81% of the total impact in SAED_2td and SAED_3td, 78% in CONV and 72% in INT. Fertiliser production accounts for between 17% and 25% of the WS in the SAED scenarios and INT, respectively. The diesel consumption for irrigation is the primary source of POF-Ec and POF-HH, causing more than 75% of these across scenarios. Watering is also an important contributor to FD, accounting for more than 30% of it in all scenarios, with the largest share observed in SAED_2td and SAED_3td (40%). Htx-NC is mainly associated with three stages, namely the transport of agricultural inputs, watering and the production of fertilisers. All of them account for between 20% and 36% of the impact, depending on the scenario. The remaining life cycle stages make a relatively small contribution to all impact categories. Given the low level of mechanisation, the use of agricultural machinery represents less than 1% of all impacts across scenarios, including the SAED
scenarios, in which a combine harvester is used.

3.3. Economic results .

As observed in the environmental impact results, the comparative results from the economic assessment are greatly influenced by the yield in each scenario (Fig. 3). The CONV scenario has the lowest yield and is associated with the highest costs per FU, i.e. 0.107 euro kg- 1. On the contrary, the costs are the lowest in INT, at 0.079 euro kg- 1, despite the higher input intensity - both for seeds and fertilisers. Total costs are estimated at 0.090 euro kg- 1 in SAED_2td and SAED_3td, respectively. The only difference between these two is the additional labour needed for the third top dressing in the latter, which plays a minor role in the costs per FU. It should be recalled that the two SAED scenarios employ a combine harvester, which contributes to the higher yields relative to CONV. This also translates into differences in the cost distribution across scenarios. While machinery accounts for around 17% of total costs in the two SAED scenarios, this share is <3% in both CONV and INT. In contrast, labour respectively accounts for around 25% and 23% in CONV and INT, while it represents around 10% of the total costs in the two SAED scenarios. Yet, the fertiliser acquisition accounts for the largest cost share across scenarios, varying between 26% in CONV and 29% in INT. The cost share of watering varies between 21% of the costs in INT and 24% in CONV. Costs of seeds account for around 10-11% of the total costs across scenarios. The acquisition of herbicides represents the smallest shares of the production costs (<5%), followed by the acquisition of

sacks, which account for a maximum of 8% in INT. When considering the average selling price of paddy rice and the retail price of white rice in the period of study (to include the costs avoided by self-consumption - see section 2.2), revenues per FU are estimated at 0.228 euro kg- 1 in all scenarios. It must be borne in mind that straw is not sold, which could otherwise generate different revenues per scenario due to differences in yields. Based on the above, the highest profits are obtained in the INT scenario (0.149 euro kg- 1), followed by the two SAED scenarios (0.138 euro kg- 1); while the lowest profits are estimated for CONV at 0.121 euro kg- 1. Although the costs per hectare of using
combine harvester are the same as those of manual harvesting (50,000 CFA ha- 1), mechanisation increases the cost-efficiency per unit of output, increasing profits per FU.

4. Discussion .

4.1. Comparison of environmental impacts of rice cultivation in diverse locations .

Several LCA case studies on the impacts of rice cultivation in multiple
N. Escobar et al.

Journal of Environmental Management 310 (2022) 114722
regions can be found in the literature, though none of them in African countries - see Table S2 1 in the ESM. In this section, the life cycle impacts of rice from the present study are compared to those from available literature in other geographical contexts by focusing on CC, TA and OD at the midpoint level, as the most common indicators with the same units as in this study. The impacts are discussed considering differences between the systems examined as well as other methodological choices related to the LCA application. All the LCA studies considered employ a mass-based FU, although the moisture content of the grain differs or is not always indicated. Whenever possible and for comparison purposes, yield in Table S2 is expressed as rice with 14% moisture - the recommended moisture for dried rice to avoid damage and deterioration (FAO, 1992). Impact values are thus recalculated per kg of paddy rice with the same moisture content, from cradle to farm gate only. As can be seen, many studies do not specify the rice variety, although this is a crucial factor in determining nutrient requirements and subsequent yields (Inthapanya et al., 2000).

As for the environmental evaluation, most studies focus on GHG emissions, alone (e.g. Hayashi et al., 2016; Yodkhum et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021) or combined with other indicators (e.g. Harun et Al., 2021; Hokazono and Hayashi, 2012; Nguyen Et Al., 2019). All CC results are in the same order of magnitude as those obtained in this study for both CONV and INT scenarios, which are 2.1 kg CO2-eq. and 1.6 kg CO2-eq., respectively, per kg of rice with 14% moisture. CO2-eq. results in the reviewed studies vary from 0.14 kg in organic production systems in Malaysia (Harun et al., 2021) to 5.6 kg in conventional irrigated systems in Thailand during the dry season (Thanawong et al., 2014). The yield
considered in the former is 8 t ha- 1 (grain moisture not specified) and around 2.2 t ha- 1 in the latter. GHG emissions greatly depend on the fertiliser application doses and their impact on yields. Due to this interaction, changing crop management can have opposite effects. For instance, Saber et al. (2020) and Harun et al. (2021) respectively estimate twofold and threefold reductions in the carbon footprint of rice when switching from conventional to organic farming. It should be noted that Saber et al. (2020) do not specify whether they include on-field emissions of CH4 in the LCI, nor the quantification method. In contrast, other studies show that reducing the input intensity increases GHG emissions. This is due to yield decreases, which can be >20% (Hayashi et al., 2016; Hokazono and Hayashi, 2012); or due to increases in on-field emissions from organic fertilisers (Jirapornvaree et al., 2021). The studies of conventional farms in Italy (Fusi et al., 2014) and consolidated farms in Iran (Khoshnevisan et al., 2014) present CC results below 1 kg CO2-eq. kg- 1, for scenarios with relatively high yields (>5 t ha- 1) as combined with net N application of 82 and 203 kg ha- 1, respectively. The case studies in Yodkhum et al. (2017, 2018) deliver CC results around 0.6 kg CO2-eq. kg- 1, with yields around 3.7 t ha- 1 in both cases. This can be related to the share of N applied through organic fertilisers such as compost or bio-ferment juice. Khoshnevisan et al. (2014) show that increasing the level of mechanisation can have positive effects on both, yields and environmental impacts.

Incorporating the straw into the soil increases on-field CH4 emissions and hence the contribution to CC. However, total CC values of some studies considering this practice are lower than in this study (Fusi et al., 2014; Hokazono and Hayashi, 2012; Rahman et al., 2019; Yodkhum et al., 2017). Fusi et al. (2014) consider a long fallow after straw incorporation (more than 30 days), which reduces CH4 emissions. The authors show that straw removal requires higher mineral fertiliser doses to compensate for nutrient removal, causing increased N emissions; while CH4 emissions are reduced because there is less organic matter in the soil. The authors also found that removing the straw could help mitigate CC and other impacts such as TA or OD. Other studies consider straw burning, assuming that it is carbon neutral (Harun et al., 2021; Hayashi et al., 2016; Jimmy et al., 2017; Saber et al., 2020). When associated emissions are included, rice straw incorporation into the soil or direct combustion for electricity generation prove better than burning in terms of CC and other environmental impacts (Yodkhum et al., 2018). Jirapornvaree et al. (2021) identify CH4 emissions from straw residue fermentation as a GHG emission hotspot in organic rice production in Thailand. Nguyen et al. (2019) find that partial and complete removal of rice straw reduces GHG emissions by 30-40% compared to complete straw retention, based on direct field measurements in Philippines.

On-field emissions are identified as the main contributor to most environmental impacts, including CC (Fusi et al., 2014; Harun et al., 2021; He et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020; Yodkhum et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021). The production of fertilisers (compost) and machinery operations can also be important impact sources (Bacenetti et al., 2016; Jimmy et al., 2017; Khoshnevisan et al., 2014). Therefore, the methods used to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions are particularly decisive in LCAs of rice. The IPCC Tier 1 approach is the most widely applied according to Table S2. Exceptions to this are: Hayashi et al. (2016), who measured CH4 fluxes in experimental plots while using IPCC's Tier 2 approach for N2O emissions; Hokazono and Hayashi (2012), who estimated N2O emissions under IPCC's Tier 2 approach; Thanawong et al. (2014), who used Tier 2 EFs for Thailand; He et al. (2018), who used the DNDC 9.5 model for CH4 and CO2 emissions and N leaching (EOS, 2012); and Brodt et al. (2014), who averaged CH4 and N2O emission data from direct measurements in eight on-field studies in California. The latter authors highlight that their approach yields substantially lower GHG emissions than those obtained using the IPCC's Tier 1 approach. The Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model (EOS, 2012) is a mechanistic model (Tier 3) that can also be used to estimate on-field emissions of paddy rice systems by incorporating several hydrological factors and irrigation information (He et al., 2018), in addition to crop-specific data
1 The studies in Table S2 were retrieved from Scopus, by searching for the keywords life cycle assessment``, ''life cycle costing``, ''life cycle cost analysis``, and ''rice`` in the period 2014-2021. This 8-year period covers +/-4 years around the year in which the field work finished (2017). The publications were subsequently reviewed to select those that addressed irrigated paddy rice systems and could be compared to the present study, based on their goal and scope, indicators considered and other methodological aspects.

(e.g. maximum biomass or biomass C/N ratio). For instance, Lin et al. (2021) employed the DNDC model to simulate CH4 and N2O emissions and yields in various rotation systems with rice over different years, departing from their own measurements.

In this study, the application of LEACHN model yields higher N2O emissions than would be obtained with the EFs from IPCC (2019). Using the Tier 1 EF for flooded paddies, 1.18 kg N2O ha- 1 would be released in the CONV scenario (including direct and indirect emissions), much lower than the value in Table 7. This would imply a 27% lower CC impact per FU. It must be noted that N2O emissions are very sensitive to soil characteristics and water management, which should ideally be captured by dynamic models as the one used in this study. As a limitation, LEACHN estimates N emissions to air without differentiating between N2O and NOx, though the latter is not a GHG. Given the contribution of CH4 to the impacts of paddy rice production, it is recommended to apply higher tiers for the estimation of these emissions, instead of average Tier 1 EFs, as used in the present study. Tier 2 EFs have been estimated mainly for South Eastern Asian countries, including largest rice producers (Yan et al., 2003a,b). In their meta-analysis of field measurements in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta, Vo et al. (2020) conclude that season-based EFs could be more useful than zone-based EFs to capture variability in GHG emissions. They also show the high sensitivity of microbial CH4 production to salinity. In the absence of Tier 2 EFs for African countries (see section 2.1.3), the use of Tier 3 mechanistic models would be desirable to capture these effects in the SRV. This involves identifying all site-specific CH4 emission pools and influencing factors, e.g. planting dates, soil temperature and texture, water management, plant physiology and biology, etc.; with the associated data and simulation challenges (Sass and Fisher, 1997).

When looking at TA impacts, the results of this study are also of the same order of magnitude as those in Table S2. Only the study of Bacenetti et al. (2016) for organic rice stands out for the significantly higher SO2-eq. emissions than other studies (0.2 kg per kg of paddy rice with 14% moisture), which show values in the range of 0.01-0.05 kg (Fusi et al., 2014; Jimmy et al., 2017; Thanawong et al., 2014). Bacenetti et al. (2016) consider the highest N application doses among studies (471 kg ha- 1), including compost. He et al. (2018) and Khoshnevisan et al. (2014) obtain lower TA values than this study, when assessing conventional and organic rice in China and Iran, respectively, despite the higher N doses applied. In the case of He et al. (2018), this can be partly explained by the relatively higher yields, i.e. between 6.2 and 8.3 t ha- 1. NH3 emissions from fertilisers application are the main contributor to TA across studies, including this one. Differences in NH3 emission estimates partly originate from the quantification method used, among other factors. OD impacts show a wide range of variability across studies, between 7.6 10- 8 (Bacenetti et al., 2016) and 8.3 10- 2 kg CFC-11-eq. per kg of paddy rice (Thanawong et al., 2014); again related to yield variability. The reviewed studies identify machinery use for agricultural practices as a major contributor to this impact, especially in organic production systems. OD is here quantified at 2.4 10- 5 and 2.0 10- 7 kg CFC-11-eq. in CONV and INT scenarios, respectively. These intermediate values are, on the one hand, related to the low mechanisation level of the practices applied by the UFPRRB and, on the other hand, to the relatively high N2O emission intensity per hectare (see sub-sections 3.1 and 3.2). It must be noted that previous LCIA methods, like ReCiPe v1 (Huijbregts et al., 2016), did not take into account the OD potential of this substance given its different mode of action.

The results from the comparative analysis must be interpreted with care, considering differences in yields and agricultural practices, mainly N application but also other aspects such as straw management or the mechanisation level. Crop management practices influence both GHG emissions (especially CH4) and crop yields. The challenge is to identify those practices that reduce CH4 emissions without decreasing crop yields. In general, this can be achieved with the use of high-yielding varieties and efficient use of inputs, but actual improvements are subject to the geographic scope and local/regional conditions (Hayashi
et al., 2016). The yield estimated here for the CONV scenario is very similar to that for organic rice produced in Italy (Bacenetti et al., 2016) in terms of fresh matter with 14% moisture (Table S2). While in the former 179 kg N ha- 1 are applied as urea and DAP, the latter study considers fertilisation with green manure (133 kg N ha- 1) and compost (338 kg N ha- 1), which implies that organic N is not immediately available. Studies based in other producing regions also estimate yields around the value in CONV, despite substantial differences in management practices (e.g. Hokazono and Hayashi, 2012; Jimmy Et Al., 2017; Nguyen Et Al., 2019). Similarly, the theoretical yields in the two SAED scenarios are similar to those obtained in Malaysia (Rahman et al., 2019) or in consolidated farms in Iran (Khoshnevisan et al., 2014), with a similar N input intensity per hectare. Hayashi et al. (2016) also obtain yields around 6 t ha- 1, but with much lower N application doses, which corresponds to a more efficient management. In this study, the yield in the INT scenario is close to the values for conventional rice production in Italy (Fusi et al., 2014) and organic rice production in subtropical China (He et al., 2018); despite differences in fertilisation, e.g. pig manure in the latter, while in the former fertilisation is based on the nutrient removal by crop without additional nutrient application. The highest yield (9.3 t ha- 1) is obtained by Brodt et al. (2014) in California with only 170 kg N ha- 1; followed by Xu et al. (2020) and Zhang et al. (2021), both with yields >8 t ha- 1 in Hubei Province (China).

4.2. Limitations of the study and recommendations for increasing rice sustainability in the SRV .

From the results of this study, as well as from the literature review in section 4.1, several aspects can be identified as key to improve irrigated rice production under financial and logistical constraints. The timely start of the cropping season, fertiliser management, and bird damage control had been previously identified as the main factors determining rice yield in the SRV (Tanaka et al., 2015). As for fertilisation, this LCA shows that following the SAED recommendations for fertiliser application and timing could reduce environmental impacts relative to conventional practices, especially when splitting top-dressing fertilisation in three applications. This may be also beneficial from the economic point of view. Although increasing N doses usually translates into higher yields, the residual mineral N in soil also increases, potentially increasing N emissions in the next crop, as discussed in section 3.1. Among the few studies tackling the relation between N fertilization and CH4 emissions, Linquist et al. (2012) and Zhang et al. (2014) found that the latter can increase with low mineral N application doses and vice versa. Hence, finding a balance between increased productivity and GHG emissions is recommended, ideally with moderate N application doses (Zhang et al., 2014). It would be interesting to explore other fertilisation alternatives, considering those products available in the region. For instance, ammonium sulphate has been proposed instead of urea as a source of N, as it can reduce CH4 emissions by between 10% and 67% (Wassmann et al., 2000). Based on the latter study, this could be explained by the competition between sulphate-reducing and methanogenic bacteria. The specific GHG effects of applying ammonium sulphate should ideally be assessed with field measurements of CH4 emissions in relation to soil and climatic conditions in the SRV; as the above-referred study, carried out in Asia.

Properly identifying weed problems is necessary to adopt effective control measures, as it was observed that the herbicides chosen in RossBethio did not target all weeds. Some surveyed farmers noted that rice rotation with horticultural crops helps prevent weeds. It would also be advisable to select those herbicides with lower toxicity, which may be challenging given the limited access to the most advanced pesticide products. UFPRRB farmers and project technicians also indicated that the use of a combine harvester increases yields relative to manual harvesting because postharvest losses are reduced. This effect is captured in the two reference SAED scenarios, which are theoretically associated with higher yields than CONV. The actual yield effects of the agricultural

practices recommended by the SAED, as well as their environmental and economic implications, should be better examined by implementing them in situ, though this was not possible in the course of this 2-year project.

Based on the literature, other options for improvement could be contemplated in the context of the SRV. Water management has been widely studied as a strategy to reduce both CH4 emissions and irrigation water doses. Along these lines, mid-season drainage, early-season drainage, or alternative wetting and drying have shown positive effects (Islam et al., 2018). Although N2O emissions may increase during dry periods, potential GHG benefits from reducing CH4 normally outweigh this effect (Yan et al., 2009). Implementing intermittent irrigation in Ross Bethio may however entail technological challenges, since this requires excellent land levelling, enough water availability during critical periods of growth, good irrigation infrastructure, and efficient weed control, which may not be guaranteed in the region (Dobermann, 2004). Indeed, project technicians working with the UFPRRB farmers identified bad levelling as a problem for irrigation and mechanisation. Irrigation infrastructure is deficient across West Africa in general (Tanaka et al., 2015); and in the SRV in particular, where it requires large and efficient public irrigation schemes to be implemented (Balasubramanian et al., 2007; Krupnik et al., 2012). Soil salinity is an additional limitation for the UFPRRB to establish intermittent irrigation, as salt accumulates in dry periods, while flooding washes it. Improving irrigation infrastructure in Ross Bethio should become the priority to increase water use efficiency and reduce production costs, while delivering further environmental benefits. Controlling water regimes during fallow periods is also decisive for the environmental performance of rice cultivation. On the one hand, non-flooded preseason for more than 180 days before the cultivation period decreases CH4 emissions (IPCC, 2019). On the other hand, non-flooded fallow can lead to salt accumulation through water evaporation from the soil surface. Balasubramanian et al. (2007) recommend mulching as a mean to reduce both evaporation and salt accumulation.

The UFPRRB uses rice straw to feed free-roaming cattle, avoiding negative environmental consequences from straw burning (Yodkhum et al., 2018). At the same time, this decreases CH4 emissions from the organic matter decomposition that takes place when the straw is incorporated into the soil (Fusi et al., 2014), potentially increasing soil salinity. Alternative options could be explored, such as employing the straw as a renewable energy source in biogas or electricity plants, which can yield environmental and economic benefits (Prasad et al., 2020; Soam et al., 2017). However, this would require further investments as well as collaboration between supply chain actors (e.g. through social networks) to link farmers to downstream users of rice straw (Minas et al., 2020). Converting straw to biochar with domestic stoves (Mohammadi et al., 2016) or to biogas (Soam et al., 2017) have proven environmentally friendly alternatives, which could be implemented at the household scale, increasing farmers' income. Finally, biochar application to soil can improve its nutrient content, replacing fertilisers (Mohammadi et al., 2016).

Developing and tailoring varieties tolerant to soil salinity is crucial given the prevailing soil characteristics in the SRV (WARDA, 2002). In irrigated areas, it is also important to evaluate the implications of choosing between shorter duration varieties that allow for two or even three harvests per year or longer duration ones that yield more per individual crop (Van Oort et al., 2016). In the Vietnamese Mekong delta floodplains, Tran et al. (2018) found that doing three harvests per year reduces soil fertility in the long term, which translates into greater fertiliser and pesticide requirements and higher production costs. Shifting to more diversified farming systems instead of intensive monocultures is thus recommended to maintain the long-term profitability of rice production. Farmers should then choose which crops and varieties to include in their crop rotations. Introducing some local legumes increases the N content in the soil, which reduces fertiliser needs and hence costs (Arunrat et al., 2016). Crop rotations could also contribute to more
diversified and healthy diets in regions as the SRV where self-consumption prevails. All these aspects should be carefully considered when defining flexible and tailor-made strategies as an ongoing process to improve the sustainability of SRV rice farms. Finally, integral management practices such as the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) could be considered. This has been proposed as an environmentally-friendly option for resource-poor farmers (Uphoff et al., 2008, 2010). The actual improvements in yields and total factor productivity brought about by the SRI in multiple geographical contexts are still under scrutiny (McDonald et al., 2006; Chapagain et al., 2011; Berkhout et al., 2015). This system is labour-intensive and requires special techniques and other resources that are not readily available for farmers in the SRV, such as transplanting of young seedlings with much lower plant densities than usual, the use of high amounts of organic amendments, mechanical weed control or alternate wetting and drying (AWD).

5. Conclusions .

This study combines LCA and financial LCC to assess the sustainability of rice production in the region of Saint Louis in Senegal, which is highly import-dependent, like most Sub-Saharan African countries. Specifically, rice cultivation in the SRV during the dry seasons of 2016 and 2017 is evaluated, based on observed practices in the municipality of Ross Bethio. The LCI was gathered through a cooperation project with Caritas Spain and Caritas Senegal, aiming to promote sustainable food security in the region. Two scenarios capturing conventional and intensive practices (CONV and INT) are compared to two reference scenarios theoretically defined according to the recommendations of the official agricultural advisory (SAED_2td and SAED_3td). The LCA applies updated and consensus-based impact characterisation methods for WS and human and ecological toxicity, namely AWARE 1.2C (Boulay et al., 2018) and USEtox 2.0 (Fantke et al., 2017a,b). Moreover, N-related emissions are estimated at the Tier 3 level with the LEACHN model, a mechanistic model that simulates N dynamics based on site-specific soil and climate characteristics, and the number and doses of fertiliser application and watering. To increase the consistency and accuracy of the results, it would be advisable to estimate CH4 emissions at the same level of detail, e.g. with Tier 3 mechanistic models or on-site emission measurements. The financial performance is assessed in terms of production costs, income and profits for the farmer.

The intensive practices of INT scenario lead to higher yields and generate the lowest impacts per kg of paddy rice in seven out of the thirteen impact categories assessed. Yet, increased N application may have negative implications on the next crop due to residual N in soil, which should be evaluated from a multi-year perspective. The two reference scenarios perform better in the remaining impact categories, including FwEU, Htx, and TA. Following SAED's recommendations on fertiliser application (in terms of doses and timing) and introducing mechanical harvesting show potential to increase rice yields as well as the environmental and economic sustainability with respect to conventional practices in the SRV. The results highlight the importance of implementing well-designed agricultural practices considering resource constraints in the region. In addition to limited access to machinery and modern fertilisers, farmers in the SRV face challenges associated with soil salinity and droughts. Thus, other strategic options should be considered, mainly investing in irrigation systems to reduce water losses and overall consumption, together with the use of high-yielding seeds tolerant to salinity. The introduction of crop rotations could be considered to diversify food production and ensure the long-term fertility of soil. Most importantly, financial strategies need to be in place to encourage farmers to adopt the best techniques adapted to the edaphoclimatic and socioeconomic characteristics of the production site.

LCA in combination with financial LCC is suitable for assessing the sustainability of alternative management practices; ideally over several years, to capture variability in impacts that are highly dependent on soil

and climate conditions. Although farm income provides an indication of the socioeconomic performance of agricultural systems, additional indicators would be required to address the social dimension, e.g. working conditions of farmers and seasonal workers. Social LCA comes with its own challenges in terms of data collection and indicators, which may be particularly difficult to overcome in the case of smallholder agriculture in Africa. Experiential learning based on information exchange between farmers, researchers and extension agents could help inform further crop management decisions. However, research projects in West Africa face several implementation challenges that often lead to abandonment. LCT is here presented as a decision-support tool for the sustainable management of rice production systems, with the aim to contribute to the availability of staple crops in Africa. More integral strategies targeting all supply chain actors (farmers, regional traders, companies, governments, and consumers) through private-public partnerships would be desirable to boost sustainable food security in the region and effectively contribute to SDG1 and SDG2.

On-farm testing of a nutrient management decision-support tool for rice in the Senegal River valley .

We evaluated recommendations provided by a cloud-based decision-support tool named Nutrient Manager for Rice (NMR) in terms of yield of irrigated lowland rice and profitability in comparison with farmers' fertilizer management practices (FFP) in the Senegal River valley. A total of 102 on-farm trials were conducted over the three seasons (2011 wet season, and 2012 and 2013 dry seasons). On average in each season, NMR recommendations increased rice yield by 1-2.3 t/ha and profitability by US$ 216- 640 per ha compared to FFP. Differences between FFP and NMR performance were mainly related to timing of the top-dressing of N fertilizer (delayed in the case of FFP), the number of N fertilizer applications (generally just one top-dressing for FFP; two or three for NMR), and application of K. We conclude that NMR offers a promising avenue for increasing the productivity and profitability of irrigated lowland rice in the Senegal River valley. 2015 Elsevier B.V. all rights reserved.

1. Introduction .

In Senegal, only about 40% of total rice (Oryza spp.) consumption is satisfied through domestic production (ANSD, 2011). High dependence on imported rice renders the country vulnerable to international market shocks with severe consequences for food security and political stability (Seck et al., 2010). The Senegalese government aims to increase rice production through support to irrigated-rice farmers in the Senegal River valley (SRV). Average rice yield is generally high in both wet and dry seasons at 5.4 and 6.6 t/ha, respectively; however, there is large variation among farmers (e.g. Wopereis et Al., 1999; Poussin et Al., 2003). Wopereis et al. (1999) report that yield gaps between potential yield simulated by the ecophysiological crop model ORYZA_S (Dingkuhn,
1995; Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997) and actual yields obtained by farmers ranged from 1.8 to 8.2 t/ha, suggesting that there was large scope for improving rice yield in this area. It has been reported that farmers generally did not follow recommended sowing time, fertilizer rates, and timings - they generally sowed late, applied late and in excess (Wopereis et al., 1999; Poussin et al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 2015). Following these findings, Haefele et al. (2000, 2001) conducted on-farm trials and found that improved nutrient management increased yields by about 1 t/ha in farmers' fields.

Based on these numerous studies, recommended N rates by Societe Nationale d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des Terres du Delta du fleuve Senegal et des Vallees du fleuve Senegal (SAED) range from 133 to 179 kg/ha, applied as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) at around sowing or transplanting, and three splits of urea (at early tillering, panicle initiation, and booting) (SAED, personal communication). Differences in application rates depend on season and agro-ecological zone. The recommended rate is higher in the dry season (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004), and higher in the Senegal River delta than in the middle valley, where extreme temperatures tend to occur and affect potential yield. Recommended P2O5 and K2O rates are 46 and 0 kg/ha, respectively. K2O fertilizer application is not recommended because K inputs from irrigation water and from dust depositions are considered sufficient (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004). In a previous study, K2O fertilizer application was recommended when target yield was 8 t/ha or
more (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004). But, when this recommendation was developed, most of farmers did not carry out double cropping and target high yield.

Most rice farmers in Africa depend on blanket recommendations, despite the fact that optimal amounts and sources of nutrients to meet the needs of the crop depend on many factors, such as indigenous soil nutrient supply, variety choice, and target yield. Scientists at the West Africa Rice Development Association (WARDA, now Africa Rice Center [AfricaRice]) developed variety-, site- and season-specific recommendations on nutrient management for irrigated lowland rice in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal (Haefele et al., 2003; Haefele and Wopereis, 2004; Segda et al., 2005). Simulation models such as ORYZA_S and RIDEV were used to determine potential yield level as a function of sowing date, location, and variety choice (Dingkuhn, 1995; Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997). However, none of these approaches allowed for field-specific recommendations.

Recent advances in information technology and mobile communications make it possible for extension workers and farmers to generate variety-, field-, and season-specific recommendations on crop management practices for rice by using a smartphone or tablet. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has developed a cloud-based decision-support tool named Nutrient Manager for Rice (NMR) to deal with such specificity and provide farmers with field-specific nutrient management recommendations before the cropping season (the version currently in the public domain is called Crop Manager; http://cropmanager.irri.org/). This approach relies on the scientific principles determined during 15 years of site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) research across Asia (e.g. Dobermann et Al., 2002; Buresh et Al., 2010). NMR provides advice on when, how much, and what sort of fertilizer to apply. NMR can be accessed through a personal computer, smartphone, or tablet by agricultural extension officers or lead farmers. The recommendations are calculated from farmers' replies to questions about the agro-ecological or administrative zone of their field, the variety of rice, availability of irrigation water, previous crop and management of its residue, previous rice yield levels, and fertilizer use. Although information is still limited on the impact of NMR on yield and profitability in Asia, it has been reported in the Philippines that fertilizer management based on NMR increased yield by 0.37 t/ha per season (Gabinete and Buresh, 2013). This gain was similar to values observed in previous studies on SSNM in Asia (Dobermann et al., 2002). IRRI and AfricaRice have worked together to develop NMR for the SRV through the use of data on yields from previous fertilizer trials in irrigated lowland rice in West Africa for estimating indigenous N supply (e.g. Wopereis et al., 1999; Haefele and Wopereis, 2004), potential yield and optimum sowing windows (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997), and expert knowledge on crop duration of popular varieties and crop management in the SRV. This paper describes the framework of NMR developed for the SRV and reports on its evaluation on farm during three growing seasons (2011 wet season, and 2012 and 2013 dry seasons). The objective of this work was to compare rice yields obtained using NMR recommendations with yields obtained by farmers not using the tool (FFP).

2. Material and methods .

2.1. Description of the study area .

The Senegal River valley (SRV) is located in the tropical - warm/arid zone (Saito et al., 2013). Five agro-ecological zones (AEZs) are locally distinguished in this area (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004). In this study, we considered AEZ I and AEZ II as the Senegal River delta, and AEZ III and AEZ IV as the Senegal River
middle valley. Average annual rainfall is about 200 mm with one rainy season (July-September). Solar radiation is high and for a large part of the year ranges from 20 to 30 MJ/(m2 day). Temperature is variable across AEZs, but the coastal area is cooler than the continental area (Dingkuhn, 1995). Soils are generally course to medium textured in the delta, and medium to fine textured in the middle valley (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004). The irrigated lowland rice production system in this study area has been described in numerous studies (e.g. Wopereis et Al., 1999; Haefele and Wopereis, 2004).

2.2. Framework of Nutrient Manager for Rice for the Senegal River valley .

NMR for SRV has been developed by IRRI as an HTML5 application which means it can be accessed through a web browser, using any of the major operating systems with equal effectiveness, from a smartphone or a personal computer (http://webapps.irri.org/nm/ wa/). For this paper, we used NMR pre-release version 1. The NMR recommendations are based on information obtained on the following:
Agro-ecological zone (i.e. Senegal River delta or middle valley) Size of the field Number of rice crops to be cultivated per year (one or two) Season (wet or dry) Rice variety to be sown Crop establishment method (transplanted or direct seeded) Approximate rice yields in previous seasons Portion of residues from previous crop retained in the field (i.e. short or long stubble) Expected water supply level during rice growing season (adequate or inadequate) The type of fertilizers to be or already purchased.

A flow chart for determining N, P, and K fertilizer application rates and timing is shown in Fig. 1. White boxes indicate input data obtained from previous studies, reported by experts in this region, or calculated intermediate outputs. Gray and black boxes indicate input information from farmers and outputs, respectively. Potential yield and crop duration were calculated from information on season, AEZ, choice of variety, and crop establishment method. In previous studies, these were determined using the crop model ORYZA_S with variety-specific photo-thermal parameters using long-term historical weather data (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004). We used expert knowledge on potential yield and crop duration based on observation at the research stations of AfricaRice in the delta and middle valley, as photo-thermal parameters of new varieties are unavailable. Rice growth stages (e.g. panicle initiation, booting) were then empirically determined using information on crop duration of each variety (e.g. panicle initiation equals crop duration minus 60 days). Potential yield of all the varieties in the Senegal River delta was estimated at 9 and 10 t/ha in wet and dry seasons, respectively, and potential yield was taken as 8 t/ha for both seasons in the middle valley. Target yield is determined by a farmer's answers concerning yield level on the same field during previous seasons, and maximum target yield set at 80% of potential yield, as the risk of lowering profitability is higher when target yield is above 80% (Haefele et al., 2003). If there is a large gap between 80% of potential and the farmer's yield level, NMR will propose a large yield increase from the current level. If the gap is small, NMR will propose a small yield increase up to 80% of potential. Also, farmers can modify the target yield, when they are not satisfied with target yield or fertilizer application rate. In this study, difference in target yield and the previous yield level reported by farmers ranged from almost zero to 5 t/ha.

The framework in NMR uses the SSNM approach, which provides scientific principles for determining the amounts of N, P, and K that best match the field-specific needs of rice for supplemental nutrients (Witt and Dobermann, 2004; Buresh et al., 2010, 2012). The fertilizer N required (FN, expressed in kg N/ha) to achieve the target yield is determined from the anticipated yield gain in response to application of fertilizer N and a targeted efficiency of fertilizer N used to obtain the targeted yield (Fig. 1):
FN (1/4) dGY GY0NTh=dAEN=1000Th d1Th
where GY GY0N is the increase in grain yield due to fertilizer N, which is the difference between the target yield (GY) (t/ha) and yield without N fertilizer (GY0N) (t/ha). The GY0N is the N-limited grain yield, which reflects the yield attainable from only non-fertilizer sources of N, referred to as the indigenous N supply. AEN is the targeted agronomic efficiency of fertilizer N (kg grain yield increase per kg of fertilizer N applied). The targeted AEN is adjusted for crop and crop response to N, based on results of field trials conducted across Asia in the development and verification of SSNM principles (Fairhurst et al., 2007). The targeted AEN for rice typically ranges from 16 to 25 kg increase in grain yield per kg of fertilizer N applied. The relationship between GY and GY0N was derived from the results of field trials conducted in six West African countries (Fig. 2). Data are from the SRV in Senegal and Mauritania, northern Ghana, Kou valley in Burkina Faso, Kano in Nigeria, and Office du Niger in Mali (Wopereis et al., 1999; Haefele et al., 2001, 2003; authors, unpublished data). In these trials, rice was grown in irrigated lowland with or without NPK fertilizer application, except for a few trials which included yield with PK fertilizer instead of treatment with NPK fertilizer application. In Asian studies (e.g. Dobermann et al., 2003a,b), GY0N was determined in PK-fertilized plots ('minus N' plots). However, in West Africa, we do not have a lot of data on yield in minus N plots. Thus, we decided to use yield without NPK fertilizer application. This should be feasible, as N is the most limiting nutrient for yield in irrigated rice in West Africa (e.g. Wopereis et Al., 1999; Haefele et Al., 2002). The relationships between yield with NPK fertilizer and GY0N were variable within each country, but there was no large difference in the relationship across the countries: 57% of the variation in GY0N could be explained by one simple regression curve
using GY (Fig. 2). As we did not have any other variables to provide better explanation of the variation in GY0N, we used this regression for estimating GY0N and (GY GY0N) from yield with NPK fertilizer (which is GY). Then, together with AEN, FN was calculated following Eq. (1). Fig. 3 shows the relationship between GY and FN. Thus, in the NMR framework, total N fertilizer application rate is determined by target yield. Use of the simple regression curve in Fig. 2 could eliminate variation in yield response to N fertilizer, and this uncertainty of use of a simple regression without considering other factors is discussed in the discussion section.

With the SSNM approach, P and K fertilizers are applied in sufficient amounts to overcome deficiencies. We used a full maintenance approach for P, and a partial maintenance approach for K, which are described by Buresh et al. (2010). Total P and K taken up by the crop are determined from the target yield and an established optimal reciprocal internal efficiency (kg nutrient in aboveground dry matter per t grain) for each crop (Buresh et al., 2010).

The requirement of a crop for fertilizer P (FP, kg/ha) or fertilizer K (FK, kg/ha) to achieve a GY is estimated from the deficit in the nutrient balance with each input expressed in kg/ha (Buresh et al., 2010) (Fig. 1):
FP (1/4) GY RIEP PCR PA d2Th
FK (1/4) GY RIEK KCR Kw KS KA d3Th
where RIEP is reciprocal internal efficiency for P expressed in kg plant P at maturity per tonne of grain (kg P/t grain) produced, RIEK is reciprocal internal efficiency of K expressed in kg plant K per tonne of grain (kg K/t grain), PCR and KCR are P and K retained in the residues of previous rice crop, Kw is K input with irrigation water (kg/ha), KS is threshold limit for drawdown of soil K reserves (kg/ha), and PA and KA are atmospheric deposition (kg/ha) for P and K. Input of P in irrigation water is treated as negligible. We do not consider inputs of P and K from organic matter as application of organic matter is not popular in the SRV. RIEP and RIEK are 6.2 kg P/t grain and 19.2 kg K/t grain, respectively. PCR and KCR are determined based on farmer's harvesting practice, and harvest indices used for P ([P in grains]/[P in total aboveground biomass]) and K, which are estimated at 0.7 and 0.15, respectively (Buresh et al., 2010). Kw is 35 and 49 kg/ha in wet and dry seasons, respectively, calculated using data from Haefele (2001) with the assumption that irrigated water is 1000 and 1400 mm in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Data for PA and KA are from Herrmann (1996) (data not shown), and PA and KA are the same for both zones, and considered only in the wet season (they are zero in the dry season). KS is estimated at 30 kg/ha in both seasons, based on long-term trials and previous studies (Haefele et al., 2002; Haefele and Wopereis, 2004; Bado et al., 2010), showing that extractable K content in the topsoils did not change without K application even though straw was removed from the fields in long-term trials, and suggesting that the soil K pool could be replenished by nonexchangeable soil K and/or capillary rise during the non-cropped part(s) of the year.

In the NMR framework, FP and FK were calculated based on season (wet or dry), approximate rice yield in previous season, portion of residues from previous crop retained in the field (i.e. short or long stubble), and target yield (information obtained from individual farmers for each season in this study), as well as input parameters defined above (Fig. 1; Eqs. (2) and (3)). The relationship between GY and FP is shown in Fig. 4. With the given yield in the previous season, FP is mainly determined by target yield, and
moderately by PCR, which is field specific and affected by yield of previous crop, residue management, and PA. Fig. 4 shows that FP is low in the wet season, when long stubbles are retained from the previous crop, and when target yield is low. Difference in FP between wet and dry season (corresponding with PA difference) with the same residue management treatment for a given yield level is similar to the difference in FP between the two residue management treatments for the same season.

The relationship between GY and FK is shown in Fig. 5a and b. In Fig. 5a, for the given yield in previous season, FK is mainly determined by target yield and KCR, and moderately affected by seasonal effects (through combined effect of Kw and KA as they are season specific). Larger effect of KCR on FK than that of PCR on FP is associated with lower harvest indices for K than for P, which indicate that larger part of K was in straw - if large part of straw can be kept in the fields, FK can be significantly reduced.

NMR considers three types of N-, P-, and K-containing fertilizers. Here, it is defined that P-containing fertilizer can have N and/or K elements, whereas Nand K-containing fertilizers do not have PK and NP elements, respectively. Basal fertilizer will be applied within 3 weeks for direct-seeded rice or at transplanting for transplanted rice. Top-dressing of N application is at active tillering, panicle initiation, and booting. But, N application at booting is considered only when target yield is 7.5 t/ha or more (Wopereis-Pura et al., 2002). All the Pand K-containing fertilizers are applied basally in the current version of NMR for Senegal. For calculation of the amount of fertilizers to be applied, rate of P-containing fertilizer is first determined by FP. If P-containing fertilizer includes N and/or K, the N and K applied in the P-containing fertilizer is subtracted from FN and FK. Then, Nand/or K-containing fertilizer is additionally applied as basal fertilizer. If P-containing fertilizer includes N and N rate in P-containing fertilizer is more than target N application rate at basal application, top-dressed N rates at active tillering and panicle initiation are reduced. When P-containing fertilizer includes more K fertilizer than the target FK, FP determines amount of K-containing fertilizer applied, assuming that excessive K has no negative effect of rice growth. This latter is the case when compound fertilizer N-P2O5-K2O 9- 23-30 is used instead of DAP (18-46-0). Fig. 5a and b shows FK determined by P-containing fertilizer that does not include K such as DAP, and when farmers use the compound fertilizer (9-23-30).

From these calculations and field size, field-specific fertilizer application rates and timings are determined, and the information provided to farmers on the output page of the NMR application.

2.3. Experimental design and data collection in on-farm trials .

Rice yields derived by NMR were compared with yields obtained with farmers' fertilizer practices (FFP) in 20, 58, and 24 on-farm trials in the 2011 wet season, 2012 dry season, and 2013 dry season, respectively (referred to as 2011WS, 2012DS, and 2103DS). In total over three seasons, 21 on-farm trials were conducted in the Senegal River delta and 81 in the middle valley.

There were two treatments: (1) FFP and (2) NMR recommendation in 2011WS and 2012DS. In both years, KCl was used as K fertilizer source, although none of the farmers used KCl fertilizer in their FFP. In 2013DS, additional treatment on NMR recommendation was included through use of compound fertilizer N-P2O5- K2O (9-23-30) as K fertilizer source, as this fertilizer was more available than KCl in the market, resulting in three treatments in each farmer's field.

In each rice field, plots of 100-300 m2 were installed for each treatment. There was no replication in each farmer's field. Management practices were left to the farmer, except for fertilizer application. NMR recommendations were determined before the season through interviews with farmers to obtain the information described above. Fertilizer management practice in terms of fertilizer source, timing, and amount planned by the farmer was also collected before the season through interview, and FFP was simulated by the research team. This was to avoid NMR recommendation being copied by the farmers. At maturity, rice yields were obtained from a 10 m2 surface area in the center of each plot, and yields were corrected to 14% moisture content.

2.4. Profitability and statistical analysis .

Fertilizer costs (1 euro = 656 FCFA) were collected from Saed data: Urea, 120 FCFA/kg; Dap, 360 FCFA/kg; KCl, 720 FCFA/kg; and N-p2o5-k2o (9-23-30), 199 FCFA/kg. Paddy price was 125 FCFA/kg. We did not include any costs for bagging and transport of the paddy, or transport and labor for fertilizer application. In this study, profitability was defined as the difference between the value of the paddy and the total cost of fertilizer to be
purchased. We did not include any other cost of crop management, or additional labor cost or bags needed as a result of yield increase.

For each growing season, ANOVA mixed models were fitted for yield, profitability, and fertilizer application rates and timings (Table 1). Treatment was considered as fixed effect and AEZ (here, we consider two zones described above; the Senegal River delta and the Senegal River middle valley), farmer nested into AEZ, treatment AEZ as random effects. For 2013DS, we performed a Tukey's Honest Significant Difference test when there was a significant effect of the treatment (Kramer, 1956). As % of fields receiving second and third top-dress of N (Table 1) are categorical variables, a Fisher's exact test of independence was used to respectively examine the significance of their association with the treatment (Martin Andres and Herranz Tejedor, 1995). All the analyses were conducted using SAS (2008).

Simple linear regression analysis was performed to identify relationships (1) between difference in K2O fertilizer rate between MMR with DAP and compound fertilizer N-P2O5-K2O (9-23-30) and yield difference between two treatments in 2013DS; (2) between sowing date and the difference between actual yield obtained in this study and target yield in NMR; (3) between yield in FFP and yield difference between NMR and FFP; and (4) between yield in FFP and difference in profitability between NMR and FFP.

3. Results .

3.1. Farmers' agronomic practices and rice yields .

Except for 18 farmers in middle valley in 2012DS, fields were direct seeded (manually broadcast). Seeding dates ranged from 22 August to 26 September in 2011WS, from 29 February to 1 April in the 2012DS, and from 5 to 23 March in the 2013DS. In transplanted rice, seedling age at transplanting was between 26 and 35 days. All farmers grew improved varieties. Popular varieties in the wet season were Sahel 202 (65% of farmers) and Sahel 201 (30%), while 60% and 92% grew Sahel 108 in 2012DS and 2013DS, respectively.

Almost all farmers used DAP or urea, and 73% used both. None of the farmers used K-containing fertilizer (Table 1). Timing of basal fertilizer application was on average 26, 33, and 26 days after sowing (DAS) in 2011WS, 2012DS, and 2013DS, respectively, whereas timing of first top-dressing of N on average for each
season was 59-61 DAS (Table 1). Only in 2012DS did some farmers (9%; Table 1) apply N as second top-dressing (at 76 DAS on average; data not shown) (none of the farmers applied it in the other seasons). Total N application rates were similar between 2011WS and 2012DS, both higher than in 2013DS (Table 1). P2O5 application rate was highest in 2011WS. Rice yields were 6.4, 6.4, and 5.1 T/ha in 2011ws, 2012ds, and 2013ds, respectively (Table 1). In 2011WS, actual rice yield was much higher than previous yield reported by farmers before the season, which could indicate that the rice-growing environment was particularly favorable in this season. For the dry seasons, actual yield was on average lower than the previous season.

3.2. Fertilizer recommendation by Nutrient Manager for Rice and rice yields .

Target yields on average were set to 6.4, 7.9, and 7.1 t/ha in 2011WS, 2012DS, and 2013DS, respectively (Table 1). In all the seasons, all the plots with NMR (except for plots with compound fertilizer in 2013DS) received DAP as basal (on average 21, 23, and 14 DAS in 2011WS, 2012DS, and 2013DS, respectively) and at least two top-dressings of N, at mid-tillering stage (35, 38, and 31 DAS) and panicle initiation stage (on average 49, 52, and 46 DAS; data not shown). Similarly, 20%, 97%, and 46% of the plots received a third top-dressing at around booting stage (on average 88, 75, and 75 DAS; data not shown). Twenty, 100, and 71% of the plots received KCl fertilizer. The total of N, P2O5, and K2O application rates (kg/ha) were higher in the dry seasons than in the wet season, mainly because the target yields were higher in the dry season (Table 1). Although the target yields differed between the two dry seasons, total N application rates were not largely different. This is because we modified the formula for the relationship between GY and GY0N in NMR between the two seasons by including additional data. For KCl application, K2O-equivalent application rates differed between the two dry seasons, which could be due to differences in target yields and residue management practices (see Fig. 5). Average yields obtained in NMR were 8.7, 7.6, 6.1, and 6.4 t/ha in 2011WS, 2012DS, and plots with KCl and with compound fertilizer (9-23-30) in 2013DS, respectively (Table 1). There was no significant difference in yield between plots with KCl and those with compound fertilizer. Difference in K2O fertilizer rate between two treatments ranged from 13 to 51 kg/ha across all the farmers' fields. Yield difference between the two treatments were not correlated with difference in K2O fertilizer (r = 0.014, P > 0.05).

Averaged over 102 plots over three seasons, actual yields obtained in NMR were similar to target yield for the NMR recommendation (7.3 vs. 7.3 t/ha; data not shown). However, differences
between actual yield obtained in NMR and target yield for NMR recommendation were 2.3 and 0.1 t/ha in 2011WS and 2012DS, respectively. In the 2013DS, the difference was 0.9 and 0.6 t/ha for plots with KCl and compound fertilizer, respectively. There was also large variation in the difference across fields in each year (Fig. 6). In 31% of the plots, actual yields were within +/-10% of target yields. In 2011WS, the difference was negatively related to sowing date (the difference between actual yield and target yield = 0.06 days of year + 17.7; r = 0.54, P < 0.05). The ''day of year'' ignores the existence of months and numbers each day of the year consecutively. A regression coefficient of 0.06 indicates that the difference was reduced by 0.06 t/ha as sowing was delayed by 1 day. There was no significant relationship between the difference and sowing date in the two dry seasons (data not shown).

3.3. Difference in yield and profitability between plots with NMR and FFP .

On average in each season, rice yield and profitability with NMR were consistently higher than those in FFP across three seasons
(Table 1). Distribution of increase in rice yield in NMR compared to FFP is shown in Fig. 7. The probability of achieving an increase in yield as a result of introduction of NMR was 86%. Yield increase of >1 t/ha was observed in 56% of the plots. This increase was weakly and negatively related to yields in FFP (yield difference between NMR and FFP = 0.17 yield in FFP + 2.5; r = 0.21, P < 0.05). This was also the case for profitability (difference in profitability = 26,630 yield in FFP + 297243; r = 0.25, P < 0.01). On average, N-P2O5-K2O application rates were 137-46-46 and 156-30-0 kg/ha in NMR and FFP, respectively. A combination of delayed basal fertilizer application and first top-dress of N, smaller number of N top-dressings, and no K application in FFP are likely to have resulted in lower yields in FFP compared to NMR (Table 1).

4. Discussion .

This paper describes a framework of NMR for the Senegal River valley, and results of testing of it over three seasons. NMR out-yielded FFP and increased profitability in a wide range of farmers' yield levels across both wet and dry seasons. The advantage of NMR was weakly and negatively correlated with yield in FFP, suggesting that NMR is better for lower-yielding fields than for higher-yielding fields. However, regression lines between differences in yield and profitability between NMR and FFP, and yield in FFP indicate that NMR will not result in lower yield and profitability in high-yielding farmers' fields. Yield increase due to introduction of NMR observed in this study is consistent with previous studies in the SRV (Haefele et al., 2000, 2001), which showed that improved nutrient management increased yields by about 1 t/ha in farmers' fields. Yield increase is mainly due to the fact that farmers' timings of N fertilizer application did not coincide with critical growth stages of rice. Wopereis et al. (1999) suggest that delayed application result in low recovery rates of fertilizer N in the rice crop. We observed that farmers' fertilizer practices, especially delayed fertilizer application timing and number of N top-dressings, have changed little since the 1990s, although the total amount of N fertilizer applied had increased (cf. Wopereis et al., 1999).

In this study, experimental design and treatments tested did not allow us to separate out the contribution of K and other elements in producing higher yield beyond farmers' yield level. In this
study, K was applied in farmers' fields with high target yield, especially where short stubble was retained from the previous crop, by using a partial maintenance approach (Fig. 5). In 2013DS, two K2O fertilizer rates were compared. Plots with higher K2O fertilizer showed small yield advantage (on average 0.3 t/ha), although there was no statistical difference in yield between the K2O rates. K2O fertilizer application has not been recommended in this area. However, Haefele and Wopereis (2004) suggest that in case of double cropping targeting high yield with straw removal, K application is needed as input/output balance becomes more negative. Average yield has been increasing in farmers' fields since the 1990s in statistics reported by SAED (2013), as well as in comparison between Wopereis et al. (1999) and this study. Also, double cropping is becoming common and straw is used as animal feed in this area. Thus, K deficiency might have constrained rice yields in the fields where such practices were recently adopted. Indigenous nutrient supplies in relation to cropping pattern, residue management practices, and yield level should be investigated in this area for further improving NMR.

A previous study in the SRV (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004) developed decision-support systems with special attention to N fertilizer application rate. In Fig. 3, three data points from Haefele and Wopereis (2004) are shown. The N fertilizer application rate in their study was higher than the rate used for NMR at the same target yield. The reason for this difference is the different approaches used to determine N fertilizer requirement. In the Haefele and Wopereis (2004) study, the relation between plant N uptake and yield, 45% N fertilizer recovery rate, fixed indigenous N supply (at 39 kg N/ha), and target yield were used to determine N fertilizer requirement, while our study used the simple regression shown in the Material and methods section and indigenous N supply depends on target yield (as shown in Fig. 2). As our study demonstrated that, on average across all the trials, target yield and actual yield were similar, the higher fertilizer application rates suggested by Haefele and Wopereis (2004) do not seem to be necessary. Haefele and Wopereis (2004) determined P2O5 fertilizer rate of 46-57 kg/ha empirically based on long-term trials to maintain soil P level (Haefele et al., 2002). This is similar to the average rate determined by NMR.

Although on average target yield and actual yield in NMR were similar, there was large variation in difference between them (Fig. 6). As we did not collect data on farmers' crop management practices (except for sowing dates and varieties) or biophysical information such as soil nutrient supply and salinity, we cannot identify the factors that effected such large variation in the difference. However, they are likely to be a combination of weather conditions, indigenous N supply, abiotic stress such as salinity, and crop management practices. It has been repeatedly reported that indigenous N supply and optimal N rates for rice vary widely from year to year, as they are also affected by weather conditions, which determine potential yield (e.g. Dobermann et al., 2002, 2003a). Also, there were large variations in indigenous N supply and crop response to N fertilizer among rice fields in the same region (e.g. Wopereis et al., 1999; Dobermann et al., 2003a). Yield without N fertilizer (GY0N), which is a proxy for indigenous N supply, in the SRV in Senegal varied widely (Fig. 2), ranging from 1.3 to 5.6 t/ha. In this study, we used one simple regression curve for determining the relationship between target yield (GY) (t/ha) and yield without N fertilizer (GY0N) (Fig. 2). In fact, there is large variation in this relationship, and simple regression is not enough to estimate GY0N for determining N fertilizer requirement. To examine variation in N fertilizer requirement in relation to the relationship between GY and GY0N, data with GY0N per GY of at least 0.6 (referring to low N deficiency) and at most 0.5 (referring to high N deficiency) in Fig. 2 were used for developing regression curves and determining N fertilizer requirements. Fig. 8 shows three
regressions between target yield and N fertilizer requirement, the middle one was used for this study. In highly N-deficient fields, more N fertilizer is needed to achieve same target yield level than in slightly N-deficient fields. Where target yield is 6 t/ha, N fertilizer requirement ranged from 92 (slightly N-deficient fields) to 152 kg/ha (highly N-deficient fields). Thus, variation in N-deficiency level among the fields tested in this study could cause large variation in difference between target yield and actual yield. As it is not feasible to measure N-deficiency level in each farmer's field and there is year-to-year variation in indigenous N supply, in-season adjustment of N fertilizer application according to crop N status (e.g. leaf color chart) would help increase N fertilizer rate in highly N-deficient fields, and reduce N application in slightly N-deficient fields (Balasubramaiam et al., 1999; Yang et al., 2003). Such an approach could be incorporated into NMR for the SRV.

Lower actual yields than target yields in this study could also be due to poor crop management practices. We found a negative relationship between sowing date and yield difference between actual and target yields in 2011WS. It has been frequently suggested that delayed sowing in the SRV risks cold-induced spikelet sterility (Dingkuhn, 1995; Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997; Wopereis et al., 1999). Thus, to achieve high yield using NMR, it is essential to sow within the recommended window. Also, since we did not record detailed information on crop management practices, poor crop management practices for land preparation, crop establishment, and weed management might also have resulted in lower yield (Haefele et al., 2000, 2001; Poussin et al., 2003). Haefele et al. (2000, 2001) report that improved weed management practices resulted in yield increase of about 1 t/ha in the SRV. Salinity - a major constraint to rice production in the Senegal River delta (Hafele et al., 1999) - might also contribute to lower actual yields than target yields.

As the cause of difference between target yield and actual yield is a complex issue and a combination of a number of factors, further research is needed to understand these factors and interactions among them for optimizing fertilizer recommendations. However, it is clear that when NMR is introduced, efforts are needed to simultaneously introduce integrated crop management practices to farmers, so that farmers can avoid poor practices and/or alleviate constraints, and will get higher N fertilizer recovery and consequently higher yield.

5. Conclusions .

NMR offers a new approach to increasing the yield of irrigated lowland rice and profitability in farmers' fields in the SRV. However, systematic approaches through compiling field characteristics and farmers' feedback are needed for further fine-tuning of NMR. Introduction of in-season N adjustment could help reduce N input in slightly N-deficient fields/seasons, and increase N input in highly N-deficient fields/seasons. When NMR is introduced, it is essential to disseminate integrated crop management practices to farmers along with it to reduce any potential obstacles which can reduce fertilizer use efficiency.
