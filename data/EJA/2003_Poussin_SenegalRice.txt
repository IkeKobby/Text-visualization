Determinants of irrigated rice yield in the Senegal River valley .

Determinants of irrigated rice yield were studied in 45 rice fields in the Senegal River valley during 2 years in both wet and dry growing seasons. Grain yields were highly variable, ranging from 0 to 9.5 t ha , with an average yield over years and seasons of 5 t ha , indicating an average yield gap of about 4 /5 t ha 1 between actual farmers' yields and potential yields. Soil P and K status of farmers' fields were mostly above critical limits and pH and electrical conductivity values were in the optimal range for irrigated rice. Average yield levels for three out of the four seasons were not significantly different. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season induced slower development rate and lower above-ground biomass despite higher plant and tiller density at panicle initiation (PI). Analysis of growth cycle and spikelet sterility levels in the sample fields using the RIDEV simulation model showed that yield losses due to cold or heat stress around flowering could be neglected. Yield variability was, therefore, assumed to be mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. Plant density in the dry season was significantly higher than in the wet season in both transplanted and direct-seeded fields, with farmers compensating for retarded growth at the onset of the dry season due to cold temperatures. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities determined at PI. Principal component analyses conducted with three variables, i.e. plant density, tiller density and rice*/above-ground dry weight determined at PI and yield components at maturity allowed to determine the effect of crop management. Sub-optimal weed and N fertilizer management were major factors driving yield variability in farmers' fields. Increasing the productivity of irrigated rice will require collective action at both field and scheme level. # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. all rights reserved.

1. Introduction .

Senegal is one of the countries in West Africa that rely to a large extent on imports to face a growing demand for rice ( /600 000 t year 1). Domestic production covers only about 20% of this demand, of which most is produced in the * Corresponding author. Tel.: /33-467-14-9031; Fax: /33- 467-14-9068.

Senegal River Valley, from a surface area that ranges from 25 000 to 35 000 ha Year 1. Until the
late 1980s, the local irrigation authority SAED (Societe Nationale d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des terres du Delta et des vallees du fleuve
Senegal et de la Faleme) was responsible for the development of irrigation in Senegal. SAED
managed irrigation and drainage infrastructure,
land preparation, purchase of inputs, and bought paddy at subsidized prices (Le Gal and Dia, 1991).

In 1987, SAED withdrew from the rice production process. Since 1994, all rice irrigation schemes
have been privatized and most irrigation schemes
are now managed by farmer organizations.

Double cropping (growing rice in the wet and dry seasons on the same field) is possible, but
hardly practised in the Senegal River valley (Le
Gal and Papy, 1998). The potential grain yield that can be obtained ranges from 8 to 9 t ha 1 in the wet season (July sowing) and from 6 to 11 t ha 1
in the dry season (February sowing). Potential yields generally decline moving inland because of
heat stress at flowering (Dingkuhn and Sow,
1997). Farmers' yields are on average between 4 and 5 t ha 1, and, therefore, far below potential
yields. Crop management practices among farmers
are highly variable (Poussin, 1995, 1998), especially as far as weed and fertilizer management is
concerned (Diallo and Johnson, 1997; Wopereis et
al., 1999; Haefele et al., 2000).

Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley often need rehabilitation because of land leveling problems and poor condition of irrigation canals. Land preparation is mostly done under dry soil conditions, usually with a disk plow. The resulting seedbed is often uneven with large soil clods (Kante, 1996).

Farmers rarely buy certified seeds. Almost 50% of rice area is sown with seed retained from the previous harvest (Poussin, 1997; Belieres et al., 1997). In the Senegal River delta, the majority of the farmers direct seed rice rather than transplant the crop. Moving inland, transplanting becomes more and more important.

Weed infestation is one of the most important factors reducing rice yields in Senegal (SAED, 1997; Haefele et al., 2000). Yield losses of between 30 and 90% were observed in direct-seeded rice and up to 40% in transplanted rice (Diallo and Johnson, 1997). Haefele et al. (2000) demonstrated that benefits from improved weed control were in the order of 1 t ha 1 or almost 25% above farmers' practice. The most common herbicides are propanil and 2,4-D amine, mostly mixed before spraying. The dosage applied (average of 4.6 and 1.5 l ha 1, respectively; Belieres et al., 1997) are close to recommended doses (6 and 1 l ha 1, respectively). Farmers often delay herbicide application until weeds are impeding rice growth (Haefele et al., 2000), resulting in poor weed control.

J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356342
SAED recommends farmers to apply fertilizer in three splits. The first is a basal application of 100 kg ha 1 of diammonium-phosphate (DAP, containing 18% N and 20% P). The second consists of 100 kg urea (46% N) at the start of tillering for direct seeding, or after the transplanting shock in case of transplanting. The third application consists of 100 kg urea ha 1 at panicle initiation (PI), i.e. at about 1 month after the second split. In practice, farmers rarely apply fertilizers in three applications. Because of late arrival of fertilizers and because farmers want to avoid that weeds profit from basal fertilizer, DAP is often mixed with urea and applied at the start of tillering (Wopereis et al., 1999). Fertilizer use is generally profitable in Sahelian West Africa (Donovan et al., 1999). Soil salinity is very pronounced in the delta of the Senegal River, but salinity levels decrease moving inland (Wopereis et al., 1998).

The objective of this paper is to shed more light on the importance of soil and weather variability and crop management on yield formation in farmers' fields under irrigation in the Senegal River valley.

2. Materials and methods .

2.1. Site description and surveys
The surveys were conducted in the region of Podor (16840?N, 158W), situated in the Senegal River middle valley, about 200 km east of the mouth of the Senegal River (see map in Fig. 1). Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley have been mostly installed on heavy clay (i.e. arid Vertisol, Soil Survey Staff, 1981), locally known as Hollalde or Faux-Hollalde. The first rice crop is sown during the hot dry season (mostly in February) and the second crop during the wet season (mostly in July). Late sowing in the wet season results in a risk of spikelet sterility due to cold in November (Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Air temperatures in February to March are relatively low, slowing down crop development in the dry season. From May to June, hot and dry winds around flowering may cause spikelet sterility (Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Rice fields are flooded
for 100 /120 days during each growth cycle. Irrigation water from the Senegal River is supplied to the field by floating pumps. The potential yield level that can be obtained in Podor with July sowing in the wet season and February sowing in the dry season is about 8 /9 t ha 1 (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997).

Our sample included 45 rice fields cultivated by 11 farmers in 11 irrigation schemes in the Podor region. The survey included 9 fields in the 1994 dry season, 17 fields in the 1994 wet season, 6 fields in the 1995 dry season and 13 fields in the 1995 wet season. Farmers used four indica cultivars: Aiwu (short duration, slender grain), I Kong Pao (short duration, bold grain) and IR1529 and Jaya (medium duration, slender grain). Out of the 45 fields, 27 were transplanted and 18 direct-seeded. Each farmer cultivated various fields in the area in different irrigation schemes and used sometimes more than one crop establishment method. One to four (the exact number depending on field size) 16 m2 micro-plots were installed in each farmer field, yielding 18 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season, 38 in the 1994 wet season, 14 in the 1995 dry season and 28 in the 1995 wet season. On this total of 98 micro-plots, 4 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season, 6 in the 1995 dry season and 1 in the 1995 wet season had no panicles at all at maturity, leaving a total of 87 plots with harvested yield.

2.2. Soil analyses .

The topsoil (0 /0.2 m depth) from all fields was sampled before the onset of the growing season (one composite sample from 5 samples taken at random per field). Soil analyses (P-Olsen, pH, electrical conductivity, CEC and exchangeable K) were conducted in the IRD laboratory in Dakar, Senegal following standard methodologies.

2.3. Fertilizer and weed management practices .

Weed management (mode, dosage, timing and type of herbicide used if any) was monitored for each field. Visual scores of weed infestation were taken at PI and maturity. Three classes of surface area coverage by weeds were distinguished: less than 10%; between 10 and 30%; and more than
J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356 343
30%. These visual estimates were calibrated by estimating oven-dry weight (2 days, 70 8C) of above-ground weed biomass in 25 micro-plots, taking four 0.32 m2 samples per micro-plot, using 0.64 m diameter rings.

Fertilizer management (timing and dosage of fertilizer application) was also monitored. Data obtained for each fertilizer application and farmer were grouped into five classes:
i) timely application, sufficient dosage ( /50
kg N ha 1); ii) timely application, insufficient dosage (B/50
kg N ha 1);
iii) late application, sufficient dosage ( /50
kg N ha 1);
iv) late application, insufficient dosage (B/50
kg N ha 1); and
v) no N application.
2.4. Crop establishment, development and yield components
Four 0.32 m2 samples were taken at PI and maturity using 0.64 m diameter rings placed at random in each micro-plot. At PI, the canopy structure was determinated from the number of plants, number of tillers, and oven-dry weight (2 days at 70 8C) of above-ground rice biomass per unit area. At maturity, rice grain yield (corrected for 14% moisture) and yield components were determined. Yield components included panicle number, spikelet number, straw weight (oven-dry weight of rice green and dead biomass) per unit area, and filled spikelet percentage, and the average weight of one single rice grain (in mg, corrected for 14% moisture) determined from 1000 grains.

2.5. Crop modeling .

The RIDEV model (Dingkuhn et al., 1995b; Dingkuhn, 1997) was used to determine best periods for rice cropping in both growing seasons. The model uses daily minimum and maximum air temperatures, sowing date, variety-specific photothermal constants and crop establishment method as inputs. Outputs are growth duration and
spikelet sterility due to cold stress (mainly in the wet season, but cold may also affect early sowing in the dry season) and heat stress (exclusively during the dry season). Simulations were conducted year-round, using 14 years of weather data from the Podor region for direct-seeded I Kong Pao, a short-duration rice cultivar widely grown in the region in 1994 and 1995. Spikelet sterility percentages were also determined for actual farmer sowing dates and varietal choice using 1994 and 1995 weather data from Podor to investigate if in some cases heat or cold stress affected farmer yields.

2.6. Statistical analyses .

Data analysis first allowed to estimate the effect of year, season and cultivar on yield formation. We subsequently removed these effects through data transformation to analyze the effect of crop management (weeding and N fertilization), regardless of season, year or cultivar.

For each plant variable measured at maturity, the effects of three factors, i.e. year (with two terms: 1994 and 1995), cultivar (with four terms: Aiwu, I Kong Pao, IR1529, Jaya) and season (with two terms: dry season and wet season) were estimated and subsequently removed through within-group reduction. For each plant variable and micro-plot i , the average of a given term over all micro-plots was subtracted from the actual value for this term in micro-plot i , yielding the transformed value. For example, for all microplots i with cultivar c , the transformed value Xi equaled the margin between the original value Xi and the average of X for all micro-plots i with cultivar c . At PI, only the effect of season was removed through normalization (cropping season had an effect on the averages and standard deviations). For each plant variable and microplot i , the average of a given term over all microplots was subtracted from the actual value for the term in micro-plot i , and the result was divided by the standard deviation of the term. For example, for all micro-plots i cropped in the dry season, the transformed value Xi equaled the margin between the original value Xi and the average of X for all micro-plots i cropped in dry season, divided by the
J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356344
standard deviation of X for all micro-plots i cropped in dry season. These transformations can be made under the hypothesis that no interaction exists between the effects (Doledec and Chessel, 1987, 1989).

Two principal component analyses were conducted using the transformed data. The first principal component analysis (PCA1) was conducted for the variables plant density, tiller density and above-ground biomass measured at PI. The factorial axis of PCA1 reflected the canopy architecture measured in the fields at PI. The second analysis (PCA2) included panicle density, straw weight, spikelet density, filled spikelets percentage and single grain weight measured at maturity. Yield was introduced as a supplementary variable in the PCA2 to evaluate the weight of each factorial axis in explaining its variability. The factorial axis of PCA2 reflected the yield structure at maturity. We used software package ADE-4 (Thioulouse et al., 1996).

The effects of crop installation (direct seeding or transplanting) and management (weeding and N fertilizer) were measured on the factor loadings of PCA1 and PCA2 through ANOVA.

3. Results and discussion .

3.1. Effects of soil variability
Soil analyses showed that P Olsen ranged from 5.9 to 32 mg kg 1, with an average of 15.1
mg kg 1. Dobermann et al. (1995) reported critical levels for Olsen plant available P from 4 to 29 mg kg 1. The range of critical levels reported in literature for K availability in rice soils is between 0.1 and 0.4 cmol kg soil 1 (Dobermann et al., 1995). In our fields, exchangeable K values varied from 0.2 to 1.2 cmol kg 1. CEC ranged from 10 to 32 cmol kg 1 and were strongly correlated with clay content (r2 /0.857). CEC may affect availability of micro-nutrients, but no signs of deficiency were observed in any field. Soil texture has an influence on soil-water status, but all fields were well-watered and drought stress did not occur in harvested plots. The pH of the topsoil varied between 5.1 and 7.5. Electrical conductivity (EC) values ranged from 0.02 to 0.23 mS cm 1. These values do not constitute a constraint to irrigated rice cropping (Asch and Wopereis, 2000). We assumed, therefore, that initial soil P and K status and soil salinity levels were not hampering rice growth.
3.2. Effects of weather variability
Rice grain yields ranged from 0 to 9.5 Mg ha 1 (Table 1), with an average yield of 5 t ha 1 over both years and seasons. Yields may have been over-estimated somewhat due to the relatively small size of the micro-plots. The average yield gap between potential yields and farmers' yields was, therefore, about 4 /5 Mg ha 1. Three fields were not harvested in the 1995 dry season and one field in the 1994 dry season due to extensive bird

damage and breakdown of pumps. Only 1994 dry season yields were statistically different from the
other seasons (Table 1). Yield components are
shown per cultivar and season in Table 2. Panicle density was significantly higher, and filled sterility
percentage and single grain weight significantly
lower in the dry season as compared to the wet season (P B/0.0001). Differences in other yield
components were not significantly different.

RIDEV-simulated year-round variability of spikelet sterility and growth duration using Podor
weather data (Fig. 2) are shown in Fig. 3. If one
would accept an average spikelet sterility of 15% or less (this percentage can be greater than 30% in
a specific year), it would be best to sow I Kong Pao in Podor between 7 December and 3 September. If this percentage may not exceed 30% in any year (the maximum spikelet sterility must still be lower than 30%), the most favorable periods are from 22 December to 1 January, from 31 January to 22 February and from 22 March to 24 August. January sowing may lead to flowering in April, when temperatures are still relatively low, in some years leading to spikelet sterility due to cold. February and March sowing may lead to flowering in May to early June, when temperatures are very high, which may lead to spikelet sterility due to heat. For transplanting, these best sowing periods need to be moved forward by 10 /15 days.

At the scheme level, the first two sowing periods (from 22 December to 1 January and from 31 January to 22 February) are too short to sow all the fields. Therefore, the favorable sowing period is from the end of March to the end of August, i.e. about 5 months. The average growth duration in the dry season is about 4 months (Fig. 3), leaving only 1 month to prepare the field for the next crop on the same field. Double cropping requires good collective organization at the scheme scale (Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Farmers will often prefer to grow two crops on different fields or schemes.

RIDEV simulations using actual sowing dates of sample farmers showed that sowing dates were well chosen. Only 1 farmer may have experienced a 10% spikelet sterility problem in the 1995 wet season. The relatively low filled spikelet percentage values in Table 2 are, therefore, due to grain filling problems, and not spikelet sterility.

Yield losses due to late harvesting could not be analyzed in this study as all micro-plots were harvested at physiological maturity. Farmers harvested their fields shortly after physiological maturity in the dry seasons of 1994 and 1995. During the wet seasons of 1994 and 1995 they harvested their fields about 15 days after physiological maturity.

The canopy architecture measured at PI significantly differed (P B/0.0001) in the dry and wet seasons for both crop establishment methods (Table 3). Cold temperatures during crop establishment in the dry season induced lower levels of above-ground biomass and slower development

with higher level of tillering. Farmers compensated for these harsher conditions by using a higher density of sowing or transplanting in the dry season as compared to the wet season.

3.3. Effects of crop management other than choice
of sowing and harvest dates .

3.3.1. Crop establishment .

All farmers used pre-germinated seed, however, the large majority of farmers did not use certified seeds. In direct-seeded fields, between 80 and 200 kg ha 1 was applied, i.e. about 380 /950 grains m 2. Plant density measured at PI was 265 plants m 2, i.e. less than half of the density of seeds sown. Plant density was higher in the dry season than in the wet season. Farmers increased their sowing densities to compensate mortality induced by cold during emergence. Plant density was very variable, both within and between fields. Poor seed quality and poor land preparation and leveling explain the low ratio of plant density over seed density. The variability between fields is related to the use of different seeding rates, but differences in weed infestation levels were also important. The variability of densities was greater in the dry season than in the wet season. Cold temperatures at the onset of rice development increased the effects of variability in emergence conditions (seed quality, land preparation, weed infestation).

Farmers transplanted relatively old seedlings. Seedling age varied from 21 to 42 days (average 32 days) in the wet season and from 26 to 49 days (average 38 days) in the dry season. The number of hills per m2 was substantially greater in the dry season (36) as compared to the wet season (19). Like in direct-seeded fields, farmers compensated for cold at the onset of the dry season by transplanting a higher number of seedlings per hill, and a higher number of hills per m2. The number of seedlings per hill was relatively high, i.e. 3.8 in the wet season and 4.6 in the dry season. Farmers explained that they prefer older seedlings because they are taller and can support higher levels of water in the field. However, older seedlings suffer from prolonged transplanting
shock, reducing tillering capacity (Dingkuhn et al., 1990).

3.3.2. Weed management .

Calibration of visual weed estimates showed that a weed surface cover of less than 10% corresponded to between 0 and 24 g dry weed biomass m 2. A surface cover between 10 and 30% corresponded to a weed biomass between 13 and 228 g m 2, and a cover of more than 30% corresponded to a biomass greater than 130 g m 2. Weed infestation was more pronounced and intervened earlier in the growth cycle in directseeded fields, and weed pressure was higher at the end of the cycle than at PI. At PI, high levels of weed infestation (weed cover /10% of the area) was observed in 33 out the 50 direct-seeded plots and only 11 out the 37 transplanted plots. At maturity, low levels of weed infestation (weed cover B/10% of the area) concerned only 7 direct-seeded plots vs. 17 transplanted plots.

In direct-seeded fields weed control was mainly chemical. Only 1 field did not receive any herbicide. The large majority of farmers used postemergence herbicides. These herbicides require field drainage and should ideally be applied at the 2 /3 leaf stages of weeds. These conditions were, however, rarely followed, as was also observed by Le Gal et al. (1990), Diagne (1995), Diallo and Johnson (1997). The dosage applied was smaller than recommended in 18 out of the 22 fields treated with herbicides. Some farmers hand weeded at tillering stage, however none hand weeded prior to the second N application, which explains the increase in weed biomass towards maturity. In the transplanted fields, 14 out of the 17 fields were treated with pre- or post-emergence herbicides at rates below recommended levels. Only 2 farmers hand weeded before the second N split, and weed biomass increased towards maturity.

3.3.3. Nitrogen fertilizer management .

The average total amount of N applied was 141 kg ha 1 and 33 out of the 45 fields received more than 100 kg ha 1. The average total amount of P applied was 23 kg ha 1 and 34 fields received less than 20 kg ha 1.

J.C. Poussin et al. / Europ. J. Agronomy 19 (2003) 341 /356 349
In the 27 direct-seeded fields, 10 fields received only 1 split, 7 early in the growth cycle, and 3 late. The first split was applied at the recommended development stage (start of tillering) and at the recommended dosage ( /50 kg ha 1) in 15 fields. The second split was applied at the recommended stage (PI) in 18 fields, but the dosage was below the recommended level (B/50 kg ha 1) in 6 fields. Only 8 farmers followed all recommendations for N application. The majority of farmers that followed recommendations for the first split, also did so for the second N application.

The 18 transplanted fields received all two splits of N, and all farmers applied N to their rice seedling nurseries. The first split in the main field was applied at the recommended development stage (after transplanting shock) and at the recommended dosage in only six fields. The second split was applied at the recommended time in 16 fields, but only three farmers applied 50 kg N ha 1 or more.

Generally, farmers followed recommendations as far as N dosage and number of splits was concerned, but they did not follow recommended application dates. Similar observations were made elsewhere in West Africa (Becker and Johnson, 1999; Wopereis et al., 1999) and Asia (Singh et al., 1995; Cassman et al., 1997). Transplanted fields were generally better followed than direct-seeded fields. The second split was applied at the recommended stage and at the recommended dosage in the majority of cases. N fertilization of the seedling
nursery will have compensated for late application of the first N split, or application of a relatively low dosage. Weed infestation levels were lower in transplanted fields at the beginning of the growth cycle, and N application will, therefore, have been more effective in these fields.

3.3.4. Principal component analyses .

The first axis (S1) of the PCA1 explained 80% of the variability observed (Table 4), indicating a strong correlation between plant density, tiller density and above-ground biomass at PI. S1 measures plant stand and growth at PI. Table 5 shows the effect of weed infestation at PI combined with N management (first application) on the S1 factor loadings. In the direct-seeded plots, management of the first N application had a significant effect on the S1 factor loadings (P B/ 0.01). Negative factor loadings were found if recommendations on the first N application were not followed, and positive factor loadings if the recommendations were followed. For transplanted plots, management of the first N application did not have a significant effect on S1 factor loadings. For both direct-seeded and transplanted microplots, good weed management (weed cover B/ 10%) combined with a first N application following recommendations resulted in the highest average S1 factor loading. The S1 factor loadings for the transplanted micro-plots were significantly lower than those of direct-seeded micro-plots (P B/0.001). Positive S1 factor loadings were only

obtained in fields with a transplanting density of
/20 hills m 2 in the wet season and /40
hills m 2 in the dry season (Fig. 4).

The first two axes of the PCA2 explained 72% of total variance (Table 4). The first axis, explaining 47% of total variability, illustrates the strong correlation between panicle density, straw weight and spikelet density. This axis reflected plant density and yield potential at maturity. The second
axis explained about 25% of variability, representing essentially the variability in filled spikelet
percentage and single grain weight. Yield (transformed data, i.e. margins after removing the
effects of year, variety and season on the averages)
was very well represented on the first axis. Table 6 shows that in both direct-seeded and transplanted
micro-plots, management of the second N application and the level of weed infestation had a significant effect (P B/0.001) on factor loadings
of the first factorial axis of PCA2 (S2). S2 factor
loadings for direct-seeded micro-plots were on average not significantly higher than for transplanted micro-plots (Table 6).

Differences in yield components (margins after removing the effects of year, variety and season on
the averages) between direct-seeded and transplanted plots were quite substantial although yields were similar (Table 7). Transplanted plots
had higher spikelet density than direct-seeded
plots, compensated with slightly lower single grain weight; they had also lower panicle density compensated with higher number of spikelets per
panicle than direct-seeded plots. This lower panicle

density is illustrated by the lower S1 factor loadings at PI. Low S1 factor loadings lead to low S2 factor loadings apart from the wellmanaged plots (weed infestation at maturity B/ 10% area and second N application following recommendation) as shown in Fig. 5.

Well-managed plots in terms of fertilizer and weed management resulted in substantially higher grain yields (increase on average of 2.8 t ha 1, see Table 7). This yield increase in both direct and
transplanted plots was entirely due to an increase in spikelet density linked with an increase in panicle density and/or number of spikelet per panicle. Our results agree well with observations by Haefele et al. (2000) who reported an increase of 2 t ha 1 through improved soil fertility and weed management.

4. Conclusions .

Soil and weather variability had a relatively minor effect on rice yield variability in farmers' fields. Simulation analysis showed that farmers used sowing dates within the window recommended for wet and dry seasons, avoiding spikelet sterility due to cold or heat stress around flowering. Harvest dates were also close to physiological maturity of the rice crop. Yield variability was, therefore, mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season reduced crop growth and increased within-field tiller density variability. Direct seeding resulted in relatively high but strongly variable plant density and more vigorous growth in the vegetative phase than with transplanting. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities at PI, as illustrated by the low S1

factor Loadings in PCA1. Management of the first N split and weed infestation levels had a relatively minor effect on plant stand at PI in transplanted plots, but a very important effect in direct-seeded plots. Management of the second N application and weed infestation levels affected panicle density and the number of spikelets per panicle in both direct-seeded and transplanted plots, but had no effect on single rice grain weight and filled spikelets percentage. Wopereis-Pura et al. (2002) reported benefits from a third N splits in terms of yield and grain quality. None of the farmers in this study applied N in three splits.

Results indicate the importance of good crop management in general in irrigated systems in the Sahel. Yields that are realized in farmers' fields are still far from the potential that can be obtained with the rice cultivars that are being used. Kebbeh et al. (2002) demonstrated that information on improved and integrated crop management (ICM) is crucial to help farmers bridge this yield gap. Increasing fertilizer and herbicide use efficiencies will also reduce losses of N and herbicides to the environment.

Improved and ICM would increase the efficiency of inputs, such as N fertilizer and herbicide and seed quantity used. WARDA and partners have developed improved ICM options for irrigated rice cropping in the Sahel that are within farmers' means, based on farm surveys, and farmer participatory on- and off-station research (Wopereis et al., 2002). For the Senegal River Valley, these options have been summarized in a manual and posters (WARDA and SAED, 2001). These posters are based on RIDEV simulations and are specific to location, crop establishment technique, sowing date and cultivar choice, and can be adapted easily. The posters give a farming calendar with management options for a given site /sowing date /cultivar choice /crop establishment technique combination, and relevant information is given to enable farmers to adapt them according to their means.

However, ICM at the field level is also strongly dependent on the collective organization at the scheme level (Poussin, 1995, 1998; Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Sowing date, crop implantation method, herbicide and fertilizer quantities are not
decided individually and irrigation depends on water allocation rules. IRD and partners have, therefore, developed software that integrates the RIDEV simulation model at the scheme level (Poussin, 2000).
